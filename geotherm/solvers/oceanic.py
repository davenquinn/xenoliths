"""
Here we implement the "Global Depth and Heat" model of oceanic lithosphere cooling from Stein and Stein [1992].
This is elaborated in Fowler, Solid Earth, pp294-295

This is a plate cooling model for oceanic lithosphere (lithosphere is of constant thickness)
Base of lithosphere is held at constant temperature T

GDH model tends to have thinner plate and higher temperatures than other models.

We will use the output of this model at time `n` to seed our underplated lithosphere geotherm models.
