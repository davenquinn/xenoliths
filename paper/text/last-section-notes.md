REE: CK-4 is altered, which shows up petrographically, but does not show
up in depletion statistics

Ca in olivine: bias to lower depths due to Ca diffusion into olivine during transient heating

Samples are isotopically indistinguishable
- Have a variable degree of depletion by partial melting
- Notably, this depletion is inversely correlated with equilibration temperature, except for CK-6

- Very low degrees of re-enrichment


- No trace of a Salinian crustal root
- Entirely oceanic material

Confirms a low geothermal gradient
Low geothermal gradient
Low heat flows

Two scenarios for the origin of ML have been proposed in the literature
with different implications for heat flow

- Slab window
- Monterey plate

The Monterey plate is geologically dumb
Modeling by E&B that it explains heat flow data better than slab window.
Also, the amount of volcanism just isn't enough for slab window

We propose another scenario to align with a large quantity of geologic data:
Mojave exposures of the subduction megathrust, disaggregation of the Mojave-Salinia batholith,
microplate capture and rotation
as well as the deep depths/low geotherm seen in xenolith and other data

Blah blah.


We do a bunch of modeling to prove that this is the right way

Backward-stepping of subduction zone continued for some time
We deal with this by modeling a sequence of scenarios

Placement of CK is ~200 km behind subduction interface, net of erosion


**Models assume no erosion, so any erosion that has occurred in the Coast Ranges
will reduce the depths of these profiles relative to the modeling scenarios
Propagation speed of thermal pulse is what?

our model finds low heat flows predicted by this method,
same as E&B's model
Accounts for pulse of volcanism (without shielding from coherent plate)
Doesn't have a stupid dragging rudder
