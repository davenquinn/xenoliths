Source of Crystal Knob xenoliths

#context
Map of southern California showing the geologic setting
of Crystal Knob and its placement relative to other tectonic
features, such as Neogene sinistral faults and the stalled Monterey microplate.
Xenolith sampling locations that backed up previous studies are shown:
the Central and Eastern Sierran suites show a record of delamination of
a batholithic root [@Ducea1996] and Mojave sites show underplating of
Farallon-plate lithospheric nappes during the Cretaceous [@Luffi2009].
The reconstructed position of Crystal Knob is shown in panel *A*,. This
reconstruction was created independently using the regional paleomagnetic framework
of @Wilson2005 with the restoration of slip along San Andreas--system
faults [@Dickinson2005] approaches. The methods agree to within 5 km on the position
of the Crystal Knob source locale at 19 Ma. Crystal Knob
can be restored to ~350 km SE of its current location, accounting
nicely for ~310 km displacement on modern San Andreas Fault and ~40 km remainder
on the Rinconada fault within the Salinian block. Panel *B* shows the location
of key mid-Miocene hypabyssal intrusives (the Morro Rock--Islay Hills complex [@Stanley2000]
and the Cambria Felsite [@Ernst1974])

#reconstruction
Tectonic reconstruction of the California margin at 19 Ma showing tectonic
provinces of Salinia restored for offset along the San Andreas system.
The view shows the disaggregated Mojave--Salinia batholith and surface
outcrops of subduction channel schists in the Mojave province. Reconstruction
of Salinian lithologic features is after @Schott1998,@Schott2001,@Chapman2012,@Dickinson2005.
Reconstruction of the evolving slab window and microplate detachment after @Wilson2005.

data compiled by @Warren2016. The Crystal Knob samples show mild to moderate
depletion in HREEs but samples CK-3, CK-4, and CK-6 show re-enrichment of LREEs.

#ree_temperatures
**A**: Per-element equilibrium temperature for
REE thermometry of xenolith samples. Equivalent to
$T_i = B (ln(D_i)-A)^{-1} - 273.15$ for $i$ in REE
elements. Thin horizontal lines represent a robust regression
(using a Tukey Biweight norm) of $B_i$ against $ln(D_i)-A_i$ to find best-fitting temperature
across all REE. Data points not corresponding to a dominantly
horizontal line signify disequilibrium between Opx
and Cpx. Open circles are not included in the fit due
to clear disequlibria. **B**: Fitted rare-earth element
temperatures and Gaussian error bounds plotted against
kernel density estimate of TA98 temperatures and associated
errors.

of the dataset.

#model_results
Temperature-depth profiles through the crust and upper mantle
at different points during the evolution of the three tectonic scenarios.
Each plotted profile represents a different model run. All model runs on panels titled with
a time occur at the same time.
**A** presents the evolution of slab window underplating. **B** shows
stalled slabs of different ages.
The hottest curves of this scenario corresponds roughly to the thermal history
of the Monterey Plate.
**C** tracks Farallon Plate mantle lithosphere emplaced beneath Salinia during
the late Cretaceous [Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections}] and reheated by
a pulse of heat from below during the Miocene slab window [Figure \ref{fig:neogene_sections}]

#model_tracers
Temperature-time tracers for each modeled scenario shown in Figure \ref{fig:model_results}
following the evolution of particles
at a final depth of 40 and 75 km depth in the model domain
(dashed and solid lines, respectively), which corresponds to the Salinian basement. All models
conclude at 1.65 Ma, the eruptive age of the Crystal Knob xenoliths.
**A** shows a scenario corresponding to upwelling-driven mantle lithosphere replacement
to the base of the crust during the Mendocino slab window episode.
The model begins at 24 Ma, corresponding to the time of opening of the
Mendocino slab window under southern California and the Salinian block [@Wilson2005].
The geotherm begins as a steady-state profile to 600 ºC and 30 km, truncated by a mantle adiabat.
The mantle is held at asthenospheric conditions for a set period which varies between model runs
(from 0 to 6 Myr) to simulate a period of active convection,
after which it relaxes conductively to the concusion of the model.
Panel **B** shows a range of scenarios corresponding to oceanic lithosphere slices underplated at
different times during the subduction history of the Farallon plate until its
cessation in the Neogene.
The youngest of these scenarios corresponds to the likely
thermal evolution of a Monterey Plate stalled slab.
Models begin at the subduction time of that oceanic lithosphere parcel
and an initial thermal structure corresponding to the Global Depth and Heat
model [@Stein1992] for oceanic lithosphere for particular age of oceanic crust.
The subduction time and age of oceanic crust covary to represent different phases of
Farallon plate subduction beneath the coast of Southern California, corresponding to @Seton2012.
Modeled tracers begin at 10 and 45 km beneath the seafloor and are advected to depths of
40 and 75 km over the first 2 Myr of the model timeframe during subduction. Thermal conditions
during subduction are tracked using the @Royden1993a steady-state forearc model.
The samples then relax to the present.
Panel **C** tracks a Farallon-plate slab subducted and underplated during the late Cretaceous. The initial
conditions of this scenario are qualitatively similar to those of the older models of **B**, except
that the early thermal structure of the forearc is set by thermal constraints on the temperature of batholithic
rocks at 800ºC at 0.75 GPa at the time of underplating [@Kidder2003]. This sequence corresponds to
the tectonic scenario envisioned in Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections}. The resulting geotherm (similar to the
steady-state geotherms without the leading temperature constraint) are
subjected to heating from below by slab window underplating of asthenospheric
material at 80 km depth for a period of 0 to 6 Myr, corresponding to a deeper version of the underplating
in **A**. A version with no underplating is also shown.

#model_comparison
Comparisons of "modern" (1.65 Ma) sub-Salinia geotherms for each of the modeled scenarios.
The profiles corresponding with a young underplated slab (Monterey-plate equivalent),
wholesale mantle-lithosphere replacement by the slab window, and
a Cretaceous Farallon slab both with and without deep slab-window reheating are shown.

#cross_sections
Cross sections showing the evolution of southern California during
subduction of a large oceanic plateau during the late Cretaceous.

#depth
Depths from Ca-in-olivine geobarometry plotted against
TA98 temperature. 90, 95, and 100 mW/m^2
conductive geotherms are plotted in the top right. Lines show
per-sample maximum emplacement depths calculated using the expanded
stability of high-chromian spinel [@ONeill1981] with error bars of
0.15 GPa. This data suggests that the samples were sourced from
~50--80 km depth.

#neogene_sections
Schematic cross-sections showing potential scenarios for modification of the
marginal mantle lithosphere at the end of subduction in the early Miocene.
**A**: Migration of the East Pacific mantle
upwelling beneath the continental margin, forming a slab window and causing
wholesale replacement of sub-Salinia mantle lithosphere with abyssal material.
**B**: Similar to **A**, but with heating of mantle lithosphere from below
without wholesale replacement.
**C**: Breakoff of slab at depth (presumably the rotated Monterey microplate)
and dextral strike-slip translation beneath te continental margin, replacing
marginal continental mantle lithosphere \figp{monterey_plate}.

#monterey_plate
Schematic representation of the Monterey plate dangling slab scenario
for the origin of the sub-Salinian mantle lithosphere as envisioned
by @Wijk2001 and @Pikser2012, among others.
