##field_photo
Outcrop view of Crystal Knob peridotite xenoliths in place within the
alkali basalt host lava.

##context
Map of southern California showing the geologic setting
of Crystal Knob and its placement relative to key tectonic
features, such as the dispersed Southern California batholith,
Neogene dextral faults and the stalled Monterey microplate.
Sampling locations for previous xenolith studies are shown:
the Central and Eastern Sierran suites show a record of delamination of
a batholithic root [@Ducea1996] and Mojave sites show underplating of
Farallon-plate lithospheric nappes during the Cretaceous [@Luffi2009].
The position of Crystal Knob is also shown, along with its reconstruction for dextral
offset on the Neogene San Andreas transform system. This
reconstruction was created independently using the regional paleomagnetic framework
of @Wilson2005 with the restoration of slip along San Andreas--system
faults [@Dickinson2005] approaches. The methods agree to within 5 km on the position
of the Crystal Knob source locale at 19 Ma [see also @fig:reconstruction]. Crystal Knob
can be restored to ~350 km SE of its current location, accounting
for ~310 km displacement on modern San Andreas Fault and ~40 km remainder
on the Rinconada fault within the area of Salinian nappes.

##microscope-images
Optical petrographic images (2.5 mm wide field of view) showing characteristic textures
found in the Crystal Knob sample set.
(a) shows sample CK-D2, with the edge of a cumulate xenolith
composed of equant olivine (ol) grains at ~200 µm characteristic scale, set against
a host lava groundmass containing <100 µm phenocrysts of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar.
(b) shows the spinel lherzolite sample CK-4 with >2 mm olivine, orthopyroxene (opx), clinopyroxene (cpx),
and spinel (sp). (c) shows sample CK-D2, with a single large orthopyroxene crystal with augite exsolution lamellae
and containing an olivine inclusion juxtaposed against dunite cumulate
material consisting of mosaic-textured olivine grains.

##reconstruction
Tectonic reconstruction of the California margin at 19 Ma showing the
early evolution of the San Andreas transform system, offshore oceanic
plates, and the reconstructed location of modern exposures of the
Cretaceous batholithic belt, the disaggregated Mojave--Salinia batholith,
and surface outcrops of subduction channel schists in the Mojave province.
Reconstruction of displaced features such as Salinia
batholithic exposures from @Schott1998, @Schott2001, @Chapman2012, and @Dickinson2005
is combined with reconstruction of the evolving slab window and
microplate detachment after @Wilson2005.
The Monterey plate ridge ceased spreading at 20 Ma (Chron 6),
which is labeled and corresponds to the similar time label on
@fig:neogene_sections|b.

##isotopes
Paired Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr isotope data for the Crystal Knob sample set
contextualized relative to major Earth reservoirs. The position of
Crystal Knob within the "depleted mantle" field suggests that the mantle
lithosphere underlying coastal California was sourced directly from the
mantle, either at a mid-ocean ridge or by direct underplating.

##cpx_profile
Profile of Mg\# measured across clinopyroxene phenocryst in the host
lava sample CK-1. The grain has a partially cannibalized and fractured
xenocryst core with Mg\# $\approx 90$, surrounded by successive layers
with lower Mg\# corresponding to crystallization in a progressively
evolving magma, and shows the complex fractionation history of the
magma.

##textures
Mineral classification images of each sample (1" round thin-section)
created atop coregistered electron backscatter and optical imagery that
show the textural variation within Crystal Knob suite. These
classifications form the basis of the modal abundance measurements
presented in @fig:modes.

##step_heating
Step-heating results for \ce{^{40}Ar}/\ce{^{39}Ar} dating of the Crystal Knob host basalt,
showing a broad plateau for the accepted age of 1.65 Ma.

##major_elements
(a) FeO vs. MgO for electron microprobe measurements of grain
cores, showing range in major-element depletion between
samples. Dotted lines show Mg\# levels.
(b) Mg\# (measured with a total iron basis) vs. \ce{SiO2} for
the silicate phases in the Crystal Knob peridotite xenoliths.
This shows the range in major-element depletion between samples,
including the low Mg\# of CK-6, the most fertile sample.

##ca_in_olivine
Calcium abundance in olivine for xenolith samples, showing the
separability of each sample's cluster in the dataset.

##spinel_cr
Spinel Cr# vs. Mg# showing two groups of samples with low and high Cr content, corresponding
to the temperature cohorts of the dataset. Mg# is corrected based on
constraints on iron residence in the octahedral-coordination cation
site. The shift to higher Mg# evident in all samples reflects the
presence of oxidized iron in the tetrahedral site in all samples.

##whole_rock_major
Major element composition (oxide %$_\textrm{wt}$, normalized to 100%)
of xenolith samples recalculated from modal mineralogy.

##modes
Modal composition of Crystal Knob perodotites. Abyssal
[@Asimow1999; @Baker1999] and Dish Hill [@Luffi2009] peridotite
compositions are shown for comparison.

##trace_elements
(a) Chondrite-normalized pyroxene rare-earth element abundances showing
the range in depletion and re-enrichment in the Crystal Knob sample set.
(b) Element-ratio proxies for depletion and re-enrichment of
clinopyroxene rare-earth elements, showing that samples have a range of
depletion characteristics and a variety of re-enrichment patters.

##ree_model
(a) Recalculated whole-rock trace elements for xenolith samples
@tbl:trace_elements presented with best-fitting
modeled compositions for depleted peridotite and enriching
fluid, using the model discussed in text. Normal mid-ocean
ridge basalt (NMORB) rare-earth composition is
from @Sun1989, and the range presented for alkali basalts
is compiled from a suite of Mojave-desert samples measured by @Farmer1995.
These fields are presented for comparison with
the modeled composition of the enriching fluids, which closely
resemble alkali basalt for all samples.
The calculated re-enriching fluid composition for sample CK-2
is not shown because this sample is not depleted relative to modeled values.
(b) REE depletion and re-enrichment trends for xenolith
samples derived from modeling in (a). For all samples, <1%
assimilation of alkali-basalt-like melt is
required to explain the observed trends
in re-enrichment of rare-earth elements.

##cpx_literature_comparison
Clinopyroxene trace elements for Crystal Knob compared to abyssal peridotite
data compiled by @Warren2016. The Crystal Knob samples show mild to moderate
depletion in HREEs characteristic abyssal peridotites, but samples CK-3,
CK-4, and CK-6 show re-enrichment of LREEs that is not seen in the
abyssal peridotite dataset, implying that these samples saw a second
phase of enrichment after creation.

##ree_temperatures
(a) Per-element equilibrium temperatures for
REE thermometry of xenolith samples.
Horizontal lines represent a projection of the best-fitting
line representing the equilibrium temperature for each sample.
Data points far from the
horizontal line signify disequilibrium between pyroxene phases,
and those outliers plotted with open circles are excluded from the fit.
(b) Best-fitting REE temperatures for each sample
with Gaussian error bounds, plotted against a
kernel density distribution of TA98 temperatures.
Joint error distributions are created using a Monte Carlo approach
for both error distributions. This approach shows significant disequilibrium in
Eu and across LREE for sample CK-4. The samples can be grouped into two
temperature cohorts, with all samples, especially the low-temperature group, agreeing well with the TA98 thermometer.

##temp_comparisons
Comparison of results from pyroxene major-element thermometers. (a) Core
and rim measurements (filled and open circles, respectively)
for each sample using the @Taylor1998 thermometer.
Samples CK-3, CK-4, and CK-7 show heating along grain rims, and the
samples vary in the tightness of within-sample temperature scatter.
(b) The strong linear relationship between the TA98 and BKN themometers
is shown, with BKN consistently measuring temperatures 30-70º higher.
(c) Ca-in-orthopyroxene temperatures against TA98, showing the
reproduction of two clear temperature cohorts around 980 and 1080ºC
by this thermometer for grain cores.

##temp_summary
Summary of temperature data showing the two temperature cohorts
of the dataset, which remain separable for all thermometers and
are centered roughly 80ºC apart. The higher temperature estimates for
the REE thermometer for samples CK-4 and CK-6 may reflect a fossil
heating event.

##depth
Summary of depth constraints for the xenolith samples.
Depths from Ca-in-olivine geobarometry are plotted against
TA98 temperature. A series of steady-state conductive geotherms for
values of surface heat flow are
plotted beneath the data, and the hatched region represents the
bounds of the potential xenolith source region assembled from the  Lines show
per-sample maximum emplacement depths calculated using the expanded
stability of high-chromian spinel [@ONeill1981] with error bars of
0.15 GPa. The synthesis of this data suggests that the samples were sourced from
~50--70 km depth.

##model_results
Temperature-depth profiles through the crust and upper mantle
at key timesteps during the evolution of the three tectonic scenarios.
Each plotted profile represents a different model run based on the same
scenario.
(a) presents a shallow slab window scenario, with underplating of
upwelling asthenosphere truncating a forearc geotherm at 24 Ma. This
asthenosphere is held against the base of the crust from 0--6 Myr,
accounting for the spread of models in the second panel. The final panel
tracks all models to the present.
(b) shows stalled slabs of different ages, with panels corresponding
to shared tectonic events, modeled at different times based on the
timing of subduction and age of oceanic crust. Subduction
is bracketed by T$_\textrm{start}$ and T$_\textrm{end}$, with
T$_\textrm{start}$ = T$_\textrm{end}$ -- 1.04 Myr for all cases.
The youngest and hottest of these runs corresponds to the "Monterey plate"
tectonic scenario.
(c) tracks Farallon Plate mantle lithosphere emplaced beneath the
central California coast by mantle duplexing during
the late Cretaceous [@fig:cross_sections] and reheated by
a pulse of heat from below during the Miocene slab window
[@fig:neogene_sections].
The second panel, at the end of subduction,
shows the geologic temperature constraints used to tune the model to
subduction conditions on the late-Cretaceous megathrust [e.g. @Ducea2003; @Kidder2006]
In this scenario, oceanic lithosphere is 55 Myr old at the time of
subduction.

##model_tracers
Temperature-time tracers for each modeled scenario shown in
@fig:model_results, following the evolution of particles
at final depths of 40 and 75 km in the model domain
(dashed and solid lines, respectively), bracketing the boundary
conditions of the Crystal Knob xenolith suite. All models
conclude at 1.65 Ma, the eruptive age of the Crystal Knob xenoliths.
(a) shows a scenario corresponding to upwelling-driven mantle
lithosphere replacement to the base of the crust during the Mendocino
slab window episode beginning at 24 Ma [@Wilson2005]. Asthenospheric
mantle is held at the base of the crust for a
period of time between 0 and 6 Myr to represent potential
durations of active convection.
(b) shows a range of scenarios corresponding to oceanic lithosphere slices underplated at
different times during the subduction of the Farallon plate until its
cessation in the Neogene.
The youngest of these scenarios corresponds to the likely
thermal evolution of a Monterey Plate stalled slab.
The older models shown in panel B are included for
completeness, though none of these can be linked to geologic features of
the margin as well as the Cretaceous underplating and Monterey plate
scenarios.
Model tracers begin at 10 and 45 km beneath the seafloor and are
advected to depths of 40 and 75 km during subduction
over the first 1.04 Myr of the model run.
(c) tracks a Farallon-plate slab subducted and underplated
during the late Cretaceous, as envisioned in @fig:cross_sections. It is similar to the older models of **B**
but is based on key geologic constraints from subduction channel schists
[@Kidder2003]. The effects of deep upwelling corresponding with the
Mendocino slab window are shown for several of the models, in a manner
similar to (a).

##model_comparison
Comparisons of Crystal Knob eruptive (1.65 Ma) sub-Salinia geotherms for each of the modeled scenarios.
The profiles corresponding with a young underplated slab (Monterey-plate equivalent),
wholesale mantle-lithosphere replacement by the slab window, and
a Cretaceous Farallon slab both with and without deep slab-window reheating are shown.
The results as shown are purely conductive geotherms in the absence of
erosion and thus might be biased towards lower temperatures relative to
measured xenolith pressure--temperature constraints [see @sec:model_supplement].

##cross_sections
Cross sections showing the evolution of southern California during the
subduction of a large oceanic plateau during the late Cretaceous, and
underplating of Farallon-plate mantle nappes during slab rollback
[after @Saleeby2003; @Luffi2009; @Chapman2010].

##neogene_sections
Schematic cross-sections showing potential scenarios for modification of the
marginal mantle lithosphere at the end of subduction in the early Miocene.
(a) Migration of the East Pacific mantle
upwelling beneath the continental margin, forming a slab window and causing
wholesale replacement of sub-Salinia mantle lithosphere with ascended
asthenosphere.
(b) Translation of the Monterey plate stalled slab along the former
subduction megathrust to a current position beneath the California Coast
Ranges [after @Bohannon1995]
(c) Mantle lithosphere beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site composed
of underplated Farallon plate mantle nappes reheated at their base by
the Neogene slab window. The Monterey plate fragment is translated along
the Hosgri fault from the Transverse Ranges region, to have its lithospheric
column juxtaposed with previously underplated Farallon-plate mantle
lithosphere.
