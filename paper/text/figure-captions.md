Source of Crystal Knob xenoliths

#context
Map of southern California showing the geologic setting
of Crystal Knob and its placement relative to other tectonic
features, such as Neogene dextral faults and the stalled Monterey microplate.
Xenolith sampling locations that backed up previous studies are shown:
the Central and Eastern Sierran suites show a record of delamination of
a batholithic root [@Ducea1996] and Mojave sites show underplating of
Farallon-plate lithospheric nappes during the Cretaceous [@Luffi2009].
The reconstructed position of Crystal Knob is shown in panel *A*,. This
reconstruction was created independently using the regional paleomagnetic framework
of @Wilson2005 with the restoration of slip along San Andreas--system
faults [@Dickinson2005] approaches. The methods agree to within 5 km on the position
of the Crystal Knob source locale at 19 Ma. Crystal Knob
can be restored to ~350 km SE of its current location, accounting
nicely for ~310 km displacement on modern San Andreas Fault and ~40 km remainder
on the Rinconada fault within the Salinian block. Panel *B* shows the location
of key mid-Miocene hypabyssal intrusives (the Morro Rock--Islay Hills complex [@Stanley2000]
and the Cambria Felsite [@Ernst1974])

#microscope-images
Optical petrographic images (2.5 mm wide field of view) showing characteristic textures
found in the Crystal Knob sample set. **A** shows sample CK-D2, with the edge of a cumulate xenolith
composed of equant olivine (ol) grains at ~200 µm characteristic scale, set against
a host lava groundmass containing <100 µm phenocrysts of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar.
**B** shows the spinel lherzolite sample CK-4 with >2 mm olivine, orthopyroxene (opx), clinopyroxene (cpx),
and spinel (sp).

#reconstruction
Tectonic reconstruction of the California margin at 19 Ma showing the
early evolution of the San Andreas transform system, offshore oceanic
plates, and Cretaceous batholithic belt. The Monterey plate ridge ceased spreading at 20 Ma (Chron 6),
which is labeled and corresponds to the similar time-label on Figure \ref{fig:neogene_sections}B.  Exposures of Salinia nappes
are shown as red patches west of the future San Andreas Fault.
The view shows the disaggregated Mojave--Salinia batholith and surface
outcrops of subduction channel schists in the Mojave province. Reconstruction
of Salinian lithologic features from @Schott1998, @Schott2001, @Chapman2012, and @Dickinson2005
is combined with reconstruction of the evolving slab window and microplate detachment after @Wilson2005.

#isotopes
Paired Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr isotopes, showing the position of the Crystal Knob sample set relative to major
reservoirs. The position of on the isotopic chart suggests that the mantle source of the Crystal Knob
xenoliths had no input of crustal material.

created atop coregistered electron backscatter optical imagery and
showing textural variation within Crystal Knob suite.

#step_heating
Step-heating results for \ce{^{40}Ar}/\ce{^{39}Ar} dating of the Crystal Knob host basalt,
showing a broad plateau for the accepted age of 1.65 Ma.

Major element composition (oxide %$_\textrm{wt}$, normalized to 100%)
of xenolith samples recalculated from modal mineralogy.

#modes
Modal composition of Crystal Knob perodotites. Abyssal
[@Asimow1999; @Baker1999] and Dish Hill [@Luffi2009] peridotite
compositions are shown for comparison.

#enrichment_trends

#whole_rock_trace
Trace element abundances recalculated from whole-rock major elements.

#ree_model
Recalculated whole-rock trace elements for xenolith samples
[@tbl:whole_rock_trace] presented with best-fitting
modeled compositions for depleted peridotite and enriching
fluid per sample, using the model discussed in text.
Normal mid-ocean
ridge basalt (NMORB) rare-earth composition is
from @Sun1989, and the range presented for alkali basalts
is compiled from a suite of Mojave-desert samples measured by
@Farmer1995. These fields are presented for comparison with
the modeled composition of the enriching fluids, which closely
resemble alkali basalt for all samples.

#ree_trends
REE depletion and re-enrichment trends for xenolith
samples, calculated using the model shown in
Figure \ref{fig:ree_model}. For all samples, <1%
assimilation of alkali-basalt-like melt is
required to explain the observed trends
in re-enrichment of rare-earth elements.

#cpx_literature_comparison
Clinopyroxene trace elements for Crystal Knob compared to abyssal peridotite
data compiled by @Warren2016. The Crystal Knob samples show mild to moderate
depletion in HREEs but samples CK-3, CK-4, and CK-6 show re-enrichment of LREEs.

#ree_temperatures
**A**: Per-element equilibrium temperatures for
REE thermometry of xenolith samples.
Horizontal lines represent a projection of the best-fitting
line representing the equilibrium temperature for each sample.
Data points far from the
horizontal line signify disequilibrium between pyroxene phases,
and those outliers plotted with open circles are excluded from the fit.
**B**: Best-fitting REE temperatures for each sample
with Gaussian error bounds, plotted against a 
kernel density distribution of TA98 temperatures.
Joint error distributions are created using a Monte Carlo approach
for both error distributions. This approach shows significant disequilibrium in
Eu and across LREE for sample CK-4. The samples can be grouped into two
temperature cohorts, with all samples, especially the low-temperature group, agreeing well with the TA98 thermometer.

#temp_comparisons

#temp_summary
Summary of temperature data showing the two temperature cohorts
of the dataset.

#depth
Summary of depth constraints for the xenolith samples.
Depths from Ca-in-olivine geobarometry are plotted against
TA98 temperature. A series of steady-state conductive geotherms with are plotted in the top right. Lines show
per-sample maximum emplacement depths calculated using the expanded
stability of high-chromian spinel [@ONeill1981] with error bars of
0.15 GPa. The synthesis of this data suggests that the samples were sourced from
~50--70 km depth.

#model_results
Temperature-depth profiles through the crust and upper mantle
at different points during the evolution of the three tectonic scenarios.
Each plotted profile represents a different model run. All model runs on panels titled with
a time occur at the same time.
**A** presents the evolution of slab window underplating. **B** shows
stalled slabs of different ages.
The hottest curves of this scenario corresponds roughly to the thermal history
of the Monterey Plate.
**C** tracks Farallon Plate mantle lithosphere emplaced beneath Salinia during
the late Cretaceous [Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections}] and reheated by
a pulse of heat from below during the Miocene slab window [Figure \ref{fig:neogene_sections}]

#model_tracers
Temperature-time tracers for each modeled scenario shown in Figure \ref{fig:model_results}
following the evolution of particles
at a final depth of 40 and 75 km depth in the model domain
(dashed and solid lines, respectively), bracketing the depth-domain boundary
conditions of the Crystal Knob xenolith suite. All models
conclude at 1.65 Ma, the eruptive age of the Crystal Knob xenoliths.
**A** shows a scenario corresponding to upwelling-driven mantle
lithosphere replacement to the base of the crust during the Mendocino
slab window episode [@Wilson2005], in which the crust is underplated by
asthenospheric mantle which convects for a period of time (several durations of active
convection from 0-6 Myr are shown) beginning at 24 Ma.
**B** shows a range of scenarios corresponding to oceanic lithosphere slices underplated at
different times during the subduction history of the Farallon plate until its
cessation in the Neogene.
The youngest of these scenarios corresponds to the likely
thermal evolution of a Monterey Plate stalled slab.
The older models shown in panel B are included for
completeness, though none of these can be linked to geologic features of
the margin as well as the Cretaceous underplating and Monterey plate
scenarios.
Modeled tracers begin at 10 and 45 km beneath the seafloor and are advected to depths of 40 and 75 km over the first ~1 Myr of the model timeframe during subduction. 
Panel **C** tracks a Farallon-plate slab subducted and underplated
during the late Cretaceous, as envisioned in Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections}. It is similar to the older models of **B**
but is based on key geologic constraints from subduction channel schists
[@Kidder2003]. The effects of deep upwelling corresponding with the
Mendocino slab window are shown for several of the models, in a manner
similar to **A**.

#model_comparison
Comparisons of "modern" (1.65 Ma) sub-Salinia geotherms for each of the modeled scenarios.
The profiles corresponding with a young underplated slab (Monterey-plate equivalent),
wholesale mantle-lithosphere replacement by the slab window, and
a Cretaceous Farallon slab both with and without deep slab-window reheating are shown.

#cross_sections
Cross sections showing the evolution of southern California during
subduction of a large oceanic plateau during the late Cretaceous, and
underplating of Farallon-plate mantle nappes during slab rollback.

#neogene_sections
Schematic cross-sections showing potential scenarios for modification of the
marginal mantle lithosphere at the end of subduction in the early Miocene.
**A**: Migration of the East Pacific mantle
upwelling beneath the continental margin, forming a slab window and causing
wholesale replacement of sub-Salinia mantle lithosphere with abyssal material.
**B**: Translation of the Monterey plate stalled slab along the former
subduction megathrust to a current position beneath the California Coast
Ranges [after @Pikser2012]
**C**: Translation of Monterey plate fragment along Hosgri fault after
following slab breakoff in the Transverse Ranges region.

#monterey_plate

for the origin of the sub-Salinian mantle lithosphere as envisioned
by @Wijk2001 and @Pikser2012, among others.
