Cobble of Crystal Knob alkali basalt containing peridotite xenoliths.

##context

Map of southern California showing the tectonic setting of Crystal Knob and its
placement relative to the dispersed Southern California batholith, Neogene
dextral faults, and the stalled Monterey microplate. Sampling locations for
previous xenolith studies are shown: the Central and Eastern Sierran suites
show a record of delamination of a batholithic root [@Ducea1996] and Mojave
sites show underplating of Farallon-plate lithospheric nappes during the
Cretaceous [@Luffi2009]. The position of Crystal Knob is also shown, along with
its reconstruction for dextral offset on the Neogene San Andreas transform
system. Independent reconstructions using the regional paleomagnetic framework
of @Wilson2005 and restoration of slip along San Andreas--system faults
[@Dickinson2005] agree to within 5 km on the position of the Crystal Knob
source locale at 19 Ma \[see also @fig:reconstruction\]. Crystal Knob can be
restored to ~350 km SE of its current location, accounting for ~310 km
displacement on modern San Andreas Fault and ~40 km remainder on the Rinconada
fault within the area of Salinian nappes.

##microscope-images

Optical petrographic images (2.5 mm wide field of view) showing characteristic
textures of the xenolith samples and basaltic host. (a) shows sample CK-D2,
with the edge of a cumulate xenolith composed of equant olivine (ol) grains
(~200 µm characteristic scale) set against a host lava groundmass containing
<100 µm phenocrysts of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar.
(b) shows the spinel lherzolite sample CK-4 with >2 mm olivine, orthopyroxene
(opx), clinopyroxene (cpx), and spinel (sp). (c) shows sample CK-D2, with
a single large orthopyroxene crystal with augite exsolution lamellae and
containing an olivine inclusion juxtaposed against dunite cumulate material
consisting of mosaic-textured olivine grains.

##reconstruction

Tectonic reconstruction of the California margin at 19 Ma showing the
early evolution of the San Andreas transform system, offshore oceanic
plates, and the reconstructed location of modern exposures of the
Cretaceous batholithic belt, the disaggregated Mojave--Salinia batholith,
and surface outcrops of subduction channel schists in the Mojave province.
Reconstruction of displaced features such as Salinia
batholithic exposures from @Schott1998, @Schott2001, @Chapman2012, and @Dickinson2005
is combined with reconstruction of the evolving slab window and microplate
detachment after @Wilson2005. The Monterey plate ridge ceased spreading at
20 Ma, and the labeled age which corresponds to @fig:neogene_sections|b.

##isotopes

Paired Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr isotope data for the Crystal Knob sample set
contextualized relative to major Earth reservoirs. The position of
Crystal Knob within the "depleted mantle" field suggests that the mantle
lithosphere underlying coastal California was sourced directly from the
mantle, either at a mid-ocean ridge or by direct underplating.

##cpx_profile

Profile of Mg\# measured across clinopyroxene phenocryst in the host
lava sample CK-1. The grain has a partially cannibalized and fractured
xenocryst core with a Mg\# of ~90, surrounded by successive layers with lower
Mg\#, with Mg\# 75 material in the outermost 30 µm of the grain.

##textures

Mineral classification images of each sample (1" round thin section) created
manually atop coregistered electron backscatter and optical imagery, showing
the textural variation within Crystal Knob spinel peridotites. The variable
clinopyroxene abundances corresponding to fertility are clearly visible, and
a late-stage melt channel cuts diagonally across the bottom-right quadrant of
CK-4. These classifications form the basis of modal abundance data
[@fig:modes].

##step_heating

Step-heating results for \ce{^{40}Ar}/\ce{^{39}Ar} dating of the Crystal Knob
host basalt, with a broad plateau for 1.65 Ma and an overall average of 1.71
Ma.

##major_elements

Major-element compositional data for the Crystal Knob spinel peridotites and
host lavas. The data is colorized by sample in a consistent scheme used until
@fig:depth. (a) FeO vs. MgO measured by electron microprobe for grain cores,
showing range in major-element depletion between samples. Dotted lines show
Mg\# levels. (b) Mg\# (total iron basis) vs. \ce{SiO2} for the
silicate phases in the Crystal Knob peridotite xenoliths. This shows the
range in major-element depletion between samples, including the low Mg\# of
CK-6, the most fertile sample. (c) Spinel Cr# vs. Mg# (corrected based on
cation charge balance) showing grouping of samples by Cr content, corresponding
to different levels of depletion. The highest-Cr samples (CK-3 and CK-4) are
harzburgite residues. Colors are by sample as labeled in (c).

##ca_in_olivine

Ca abundance in olivine for xenolith samples, showing the per-sample
separability of microprobe analyses (colored by sample) despite low measured
abundances.

##spinel_cr

Spinel Cr# vs. Mg# showing two groups of samples with low and high Cr content,
corresponding to different levels of depletion. Mg# is corrected based cation charge balance.
The highest-Cr samples (CK-3 and CK-4)
are harzburgite residues, while the CK-6 is an apparently refertilized lherzolite.

##whole_rock_major

Major element composition (oxide %$_\textrm{wt}$, normalized to 100%) of
xenolith samples recalculated from modal mineralogy.

##modes

Modal composition of Crystal Knob peridotites. Abyssal
[@Asimow1999; @Baker1999] and Dish Hill [@Luffi2009] peridotite
compositions are shown for comparison.

##trace_elements

‌(a) Chondrite-normalized pyroxene rare-earth element abundances showing
the range in depletion and re-enrichment in the Crystal Knob sample set.
(b) Element-ratio proxies for depletion and re-enrichment of
clinopyroxene rare-earth elements, showing that samples have a range of
depletion characteristics and a variety of re-enrichment patters. Colors are by
sample as labeled in (b).


##ree_model

‌(a) Recalculated whole-rock trace elements for xenolith samples
[@tbl:trace_elements_table] presented with best-fitting
modeled compositions for depleted peridotite and enriching
fluid, using the model discussed in text. The rare-earth compositions of
normal mid-ocean ridge basalt (NMORB) [@Sun1989] and alkali basalt [@Farmer1995]
are presented for comparison with
the modeled composition of the enriching fluids, which closely
resemble alkali basalt for all samples.
Sample CK-2 shows no excess enrichment, and
a hypothetical re-enriching fluid composition is not calculated.
(b) REE depletion and re-enrichment trends for xenolith
samples derived from modeling in (a). For all samples, <1%
assimilation of alkali-basalt-like melt is
required to explain the observed trends of REE re-enrichment.

##cpx_literature_comparison

Clinopyroxene trace elements for Crystal Knob compared to abyssal peridotite
data compiled by @Warren2016. The Crystal Knob samples show mild to moderate
depletion in HREEs characteristic abyssal peridotites, but samples CK-3, CK-4,
and CK-6 show re-enrichment of LREEs that is not seen in the abyssal peridotite
dataset, implying that these samples saw a second phase of enrichment after
creation. Colors are by sample.

##ree_temperatures

REE thermometry of xenolith samples. (a) Per-element equilibrium temperatures
with projection of best-fitting sample temperature as horizontal lines for each
sample. Data points far from the horizontal line signify disequilibrium between
pyroxene phases, and those outliers plotted with open circles are excluded from
the fit. (b) Best-fitting REE temperatures for each sample with Gaussian error
bounds, plotted against a kernel density distribution of TA98 major-element
temperatures. Joint error distributions are created using a Monte Carlo
approach for both error distributions. This approach shows significant
disequilibrium in Eu and across LREE for sample CK-4. The samples can be
grouped into two temperature cohorts, with all samples, especially the
low-temperature group, agreeing well with the TA98 thermometer. Colors are by
sample.


##temp_comparisons

Comparison of results from pyroxene major-element thermometers. (a) Core and
rim measurements (filled and open circles, respectively) for each sample using
the @Taylor1998 thermometer. Samples CK-3, CK-4, and CK-7 show heating along
grain rims, and the tightness of within-sample temperature scatter varies. (b)
The strong linear relationship between the TA98 and BKN themometers is shown,
with BKN consistently measuring temperatures 30-70º higher. (c)
Ca-in-orthopyroxene temperatures against TA98, showing the reproduction of
two temperature cohorts around 980 and 1080ºC by this thermometer for grain
cores. Colors are by sample as labeled in (a). Grey lines show 1:1
relationship.

##temp_summary

Summary of temperature and depletion-degree data for the peridotite xenoliths
showing the two temperature cohorts of the dataset, which remain separable for
all thermometers and are centered roughly 80ºC apart. Estimates for all
thermometers track together except for the higher temperature estimates for the
REE thermometer for samples CK-4 and CK-6, which may reflect a fossil heating
event. Spinel Cr\# and several melt-extraction proxies are used to assess the
level of depletion of the samples. The lower-temperature samples are generally
less depleted in all systems, with variable MgO and \ce{Al2O3} depletion
reflecting low modal abundances of pyroxene. Sample CK-6 has moderately high
spinel Cr\# but low levels of whole-rock depletion, suggesting bulk
assimilation of an enriching fluid.

##depth

Summary of depth constraints for the xenolith samples. Colored field represent
density contours of Monte Carlo error distributions of Ca-in-olivine
pressure/TA98 temperature pairs for each sample, accounting for analytical
errors and within-sample scatter. Plots on the right margin project these
distributions along the depth axis. Colored, dashed lines show estimates of the
maximum spinel stability depth for spinel Cr content matching each sample
[@ONeill1981], with imposed error bars of 0.15 GPa. The hatched background
represents P-T bounds of the potential xenolith source region based on
thermobarometry and phase stability. Steady-state conductive geotherms for
values of surface heat flow $q_0$ are plotted beneath the data, with 80-90
mW/m^2 highlighted as maximum reasonable geotherms for the mantle. A dashed box
shows the extent of sample temperatures along these geotherms. The synthesis of
this data suggests that the samples were sourced from ~45--75 km depth.

##model_results

Temperature-depth profiles through the crust and upper mantle at key timesteps
during the evolution of the three tectonic scenarios shown in
@fig:model_tracers. Each profile represents a different model run based
on the same scenario. (a) A shallow slab window scenario, with underplating of
upwelling asthenosphere truncating a forearc geotherm at 24 Ma. This
asthenosphere is held against the base of the crust from 0--6 Myr, accounting
for the spread of models in the second panel. The final panel tracks all models
to the present. (b) Stalled slabs of different ages, with panels
corresponding to shared tectonic events, modeled at different times based on
the timing of subduction and age of oceanic crust. Subduction is bracketed by
T$_\textrm{start}$ and T$_\textrm{end}$, with T$_\textrm{start}$
= T$_\textrm{end}$ -- 1.04 Myr for all cases. The youngest and hottest of
these runs corresponds to the "Monterey plate" tectonic scenario. (c) Farallon
Plate mantle lithosphere emplaced beneath the central California coast by
mantle duplexing during the late Cretaceous [@fig:cross_sections] and reheated
by a pulse of heat from below during the Miocene slab window
[@fig:neogene_sections]. The second panel, at the end of subduction, shows the
geologic temperature constraints used to tune the model to subduction
conditions on the late-Cretaceous megathrust [e.g. @Ducea2003; @Kidder2006]
In this scenario, oceanic lithosphere is 55 Myr old at the time of
subduction.

##model_tracers

Temperature-time tracers for each modeled scenario, following the evolution of
particles at final depths of 40 and 75 km in the model domain (dashed and solid
lines, respectively), bracketing the boundary conditions of the Crystal Knob
xenolith suite. All models conclude at 1.65 Ma, the eruptive age of the Crystal
Knob xenoliths. (a) Upwelling-driven mantle lithosphere replacement to the base
of the crust during the Mendocino slab window episode beginning at 24 Ma
[@Wilson2005]. Asthenospheric mantle is held at the base of the crust for
a period of time between 0 and 6 Myr to represent potential durations of active
convection. (b) Oceanic lithosphere slices underplated at different times until
the cessation of Farallon-plate subduction in the Neogene. The youngest of
these scenarios corresponds to the likely thermal evolution of a Monterey Plate
stalled slab. The models with subduction times >30 Ma are included for
completeness, though they do not correspond to specific events recorded by
geologic features in coastal California. Model tracers begin at 10 and
45 km beneath the seafloor and are advected to depths of 40 and 75 km during
subduction over the first 1.04 Myr of the model run. (c) A Farallon-plate
slab subducted and underplated during the late Cretaceous, as envisioned in
@fig:cross_sections. While similar to the older models of **B**, it is tuned
for key thermobarometric constraints on subduction channel schists
[@Kidder2003]. The effect of Mendocino slab window upwelling at the base of
this section is shown, with timing equivalent to the replacement of the
entire mantle lithosphere represented in (a).

##model_comparison

Comparisons of Crystal Knob eruptive (1.65 Ma) sub-Salinia geotherms for each
of the modeled scenarios. The hottest model run of each group is highlighted,
with cooler models of the same family shown with lower opacity.
The model predictions are purely conductive geotherms, and arrows show the
potential response of model geotherms to erosion [see @sec:model_supplement].
The background of the plot shows steady-state geotherms and the likely field of
xenolith entrainment from @fig:depth.

##cross_sections
Cross sections showing the evolution of southern California during the
subduction of a large oceanic plateau during the late Cretaceous, and
underplating of Farallon-plate mantle nappes during slab rollback
[after @Saleeby2003; @Luffi2009; @Chapman2010].

##neogene_sections

Schematic cross-sections showing potential scenarios for modification of the
marginal mantle lithosphere at the end of subduction in the early Miocene.
Forearc crust (orange) is generalized for late-Cretaceous inherited structure
[see @fig:cross_sections], including Salina nappes and associated
Franciscan-complex fragments.
(a) Migration of the East Pacific mantle upwelling beneath the continental
margin, forming a slab window and causing wholesale replacement of sub-Salinia
mantle lithosphere with ascended asthenosphere. (b) Translation of the Monterey
plate stalled slab along the former subduction megathrust to a current position
beneath the California Coast Ranges [after @Bohannon1995]
(c) Mantle lithosphere beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site composed of
underplated Farallon plate mantle nappes reheated at their base by the Neogene
slab window. The Monterey plate fragment is translated along the Hosgri fault
from the Transverse Ranges region, to have its lithospheric column juxtaposed
with previously underplated Farallon-plate mantle lithosphere.
