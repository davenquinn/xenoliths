    Map of southern California showing the geologic setting
    of Crystal Knob and its placement relative to other tectonic
    features, such as Neogene sinistral faults and the stalled Monterey microplate.
    Xenolith sampling locations that backed up previous studies are shown:
    the Central and Eastern Sierran suites show a record of delamination of
    a batholithic root [@Ducea1996] and Mojave sites show underplating of
    Farallon-plate lithospheric nappes during the Cretaceous [@Luffi2009].
    The reconstructed position of Crystal Knob is shown in panel *A*,. This
    reconstruction was created independently using the regional paleomagnetic framework
    of @Wilson2005 with the restoration of slip along San Andreas--system
    faults [@Dickinson2005] approaches. The methods agree to within 5 km on the position
    of the Crystal Knob source locale at 19 Ma. Crystal Knob
    can be restored to ~350 km SE of its current location, accounting
    nicely for ~310 km displacement on modern San Andreas Fault and ~40 km remainder
    on the Rinconada fault within the Salinian block. Panel *B* shows the location
    of key mid-Miocene hypabyssal intrusives (the Morro Rock--Islay Hills complex [@Stanley2000]
    and the Cambria Felsite [@Ernst1974])

    Temperature-depth profiles through the crust and upper mantle
    at different points during the evolution of the three tectonic scenarios.
    Each plotted profile represents a different model run. All model runs on panels titled with
    a time occur at the same time.
    **A** presents the evolution of slab window underplating. **B** shows
    stalled slabs of different ages.
    The hottest curves of this scenario corresponds roughly to the thermal history
    of the Monterey Plate.
    **C** tracks Farallon Plate mantle lithosphere emplaced beneath Salinia during
    the late Cretaceous [Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections}] and reheated by
    a pulse of heat from below during the Miocene slab window [Figure \ref{fig:neogene_sections}]

    Temperature-time tracers for each modeled scenario shown in Figure \ref{fig:model_results}
    following the evolution of particles
    at a final depth of 40 and 75 km depth in the model domain
    (dashed and solid lines, respectively), which corresponds to the Salinian basement. All models
    conclude at 1.65 Ma, the eruptive age of the Crystal Knob xenoliths.
    **A** shows a scenario corresponding to upwelling-driven mantle lithosphere replacement
    to the base of the crust during the Mendocino slab window episode.
    The model begins at 24 Ma, corresponding to the time of opening of the
    Mendocino slab window under southern California and the Salinian block [@Wilson2005].
    The geotherm begins as a steady-state profile to 600 ºC and 30 km, truncated by a mantle adiabat.
    The mantle is held at asthenospheric conditions for a set period which varies between model runs
    (from 0 to 6 Myr) to simulate a period of active convection,
    after which it relaxes conductively to the concusion of the model.
    Panel **B** shows a range of scenarios corresponding to oceanic lithosphere slices underplated at
    different times during the subduction history of the Farallon plate until its
    cessation in the Neogene.
    The youngest of these scenarios corresponds to the likely
    thermal evolution of a Monterey Plate stalled slab.
    Models begin at the subduction time of that oceanic lithosphere parcel
    and an initial thermal structure corresponding to the Global Depth and Heat
    model [@Stein1992] for oceanic lithosphere for particular age of oceanic crust.
    The subduction time and age of oceanic crust covary to represent different phases of
    Farallon plate subduction beneath the coast of Southern California, corresponding to @Seton2012.
    Modeled tracers begin at 10 and 45 km beneath the seafloor and are advected to depths of
    40 and 75 km over the first 2 Myr of the model timeframe during subduction. Thermal conditions
    during subduction are tracked using the @Royden1993a steady-state forearc model.
    The samples then relax to the present.
    Panel **C** tracks a Farallon-plate slab subducted and underplated during the late Cretaceous. The initial
    conditions of this scenario are qualitatively similar to those of the older models of **B**, except
    that the early thermal structure of the forearc is set by thermal constraints on the temperature of batholithic
    rocks at 800ºC at 0.75 GPa at the time of underplating [@Kidder2003]. This sequence corresponds to
    the tectonic scenario envisioned in Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections}. The resulting geotherm (similar to the
    steady-state geotherms without the leading temperature constraint) are
    subjected to heating from below by slab window underplating of asthenospheric
    material at 80 km depth for a period of 0 to 6 Myr, corresponding to a deeper version of the underplating
    in **A**. A version with no underplating is also shown.
