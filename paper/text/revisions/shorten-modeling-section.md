THERMAL MODELING HEADERS COPIED FORM YOUR MANUSCRIPT DRAFT:

## Thermal constraints on lithospheric structure and history p. 30

Much of this material does belong in the main text as an introduction for the thermal modeling

## The depth of slab window underplating p. 31

This belongs somewhere in the main text in conjunction with model setup

## Thermal modeling of tectonic scenarios  p. 32

It seems like much of this material belongs in “Model Results”?

## Model setup  p. 33

Model set up in the main text needs to be as complete and robust as possible, and can include brief summaries from the four following sections, much of which can be presented in more detail in Supplementary

- Oceanic geotherm p. 34
- Supra-subduction geotherm p.34
- Underplating p. 35
- Model simplifications p. 35
- Model results p.36-37

Model Results should be a clear text module that can reference the Supplementary file as needed
