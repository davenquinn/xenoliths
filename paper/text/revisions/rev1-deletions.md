Introduction
============

In systems of ongoing subduction, the augmentation of continental
lithosphere is largely driven by the emplacement magmatic arcs
[@Nadin2008]<!-- Better reference? -->. However, it has
recently become apparent that the underplating of subducted material can
significantly modify the continental basement.

The western margin of North America has been built by both of these
processes. Large volumes of new crust were created during the Mesozoic
with the formation of the cordilleran magmatic arc [e.g. @Ducea1998],
now represented in the Sierra Nevada and Peninsular Range batholiths.
Between these intact arc remnants, the segment of batholith underlying
the Mojave Province was dispersed following late-Cretaceous uplift and
subsequent extensional collapse. This episode is associated with a
period of flat-slab subduction followed by slab rollback [@Liu2010]. As
a result of this episode, the geologic province is entirely underlain by
Farallon--plate mantle lithosphere [@Luffi2009].

It is unclear which subduction conditions can lead to the accretion of
oceanic material at depth -- is a major episode of flat-slab subduction
required, or can other events (potentially with less-pronounced
signatures at the crustal level) lead to the large-scale underplating of
mantle lithosphere? If this is the case, then the mantle lithosphere
under coastal regions could have been accreted in one of several
episodes.

In addition to late-Cretaceous extension and rollback, In the Oligocene,
subduction of the East Pacific Rise under the continental margin created
a northward-propagating triple-junction, leading to the end of
subduction and the development of the San Andreas transform plate
boundary. Shearing of the continental borderland along this
right-lateral system continues to the present. Stalled remnant slabs
related to the progressive cessation of subduction have been proposed as
a possible component of the mantle lithosphere underlying coastal
California [@Wijk2001; @Pikser2012].

and studied as signatures of augmentation of the

## Emplacement of the mantle lithosphere

Studies of the deep lithosphere along the cordillera have built an
increasingly integrated picture of Cenozoic tectonics, yielding new
insights into the effects of subduction-zone instability and cessation.
Ultramafic xenoliths entrained in recent (\<10 Ma) low-volume magmas have
been particularly fruitful in this regard. Xenoliths from the Sierra
Nevada \figref{context} show the existence of a dense keel of arc
residues underlying the batholith and record a westward-progressing
delamination of this crustal root from 10 Ma to present
[@Ducea1996;@Saleeby2012]. In the Mojave Province, xenoliths from Dish
Hill and Cima Dome have shown that mantle lithosphere beneath the
disaggregated Southern California Batholith was partially replaced by
Farallon-plate remnants during the late Cretaceous [@Luffi2009].
Xenoliths sampling the lithospheric column provide rare glimpses of
structure and composition at depth.
The rarity and irregular spatial
distribution of xenolith-hosting lavas make new sampling locations
extremely valuable.
As yet, no xenolith studies have queried the mantle lithosphere outboard of the Mojave province.
This new dataset provides a valuable window into the tectonic evolution of western
California.

# Franciscan and Crystal Knob locations

The Franciscan assemblage hosting Crystal Knob was thrust
beneath the Salinian block during the Cretaceous and has since been
coupled to the province [@Chapman2016]. Composed primarily of Cretaceous arc tonalites
and granodiorites, the Salinian block is a western extension of the
Mojave province that has been translated 315 km northwest along the San
Andreas fault in the Neogene [@Ducea2003; @Hall2013]. Crystal Knob samples
the basement of this tectonic block.

Crystal Knob is 20 km from the Big Sur coast, much closer to the
continental margin than any previously-studied xenolith locale in
southern and central California \figref{context}. The area has undergone
a multistage tectonic history as part of the forearc during progressing
subduction and formation of the San Andreas transform system. The
potential for overprinting by later processes leads to substantial
ambiguity as to the upper-mantle structure beneath this region.
A petrologic examination of these models and examination of their
geodynamic framework can lead to an improved understanding of the
evolution of the western North American margin from the Laramide to
present.

## Host lava

\ce{^{39}Ar}/\ce{^{40}Ar} dating show that the Crystal Knob lava was
erupted at 1.65 Ma \figref{step_heating}. In addition to carrying
relatively pristine peridotite samples, there is significant textural
and compositional evidence that the magma significantly fractionated
during its evolution and ascent.


<!-- Strong Eu anomalies suggest that rare-earth fractionation occurred
in the presence of plagioclase feldspar. This suggests that REEs were
equilibrated at shallow lithospheric levels. However, similar anomalies
are not documented in canonical studies of mid-ocean ridge peridotites
[@Johnson1990]. -->
<!--[[enrichment_trends|figure]]-->

Surface temperatures may be transient especially if the system is
quickly evolving.

# Origin of the mantle lithosphere

Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic data from this study confirm that the sub-Salinia
mantle lithosphere is sourced from the abyssal mantle, and shows no
contribution from recycled crustal material. This shows that it does
not represent the root of the North American cratonic basement or Salinian magmatic
arc and must be underplated material wholly sourced from the convecting mantle [@Ducea1996].

The presence of underplated material beneath the Salinian block
is in line with the results of seismic surveys [@Trehu1991,@Miller1992],
which have demonstrated the presence of high V_$\textrm{p}$
material at 20-30 km beneath the Coast Ranges near Crystal Knob.
This gently eastward-dipping layer extends as far east as the
San Andreas fault and has been widely interpreted to be underplated
[@Trehu1991;@Brocher1999;@Wilson2005]
due to its apparently mafic nature.

Both the seismic observation of a sharp truncation of the lower crust by mafic
material and the isotopically-depleted nature of the Crystal Knob xenoliths
can be explained either by subduction and underplating of suboceanic lithosphere
or mantle upwelling beneath the crust. Both underplating of subducted material
and asthenospheric upwelling are documented responses of central California margin
to Neogene tectonic events [e.g. @Atwater1998; @Luffi2009], and *stalled slab* and
*slab window* models for underplating have been proposed which correspond to these
mechanisms [@Erkan2008;@Groome2009]. To illuminate how the Crystal Knob samples
may fit into this conceptual
framework, we must examine the tectonic processes that have affected the
sub-Salinia mantle lithosphere over the history of the crustal block.

### Neogene tectonic history

In the early Neogene, ridge subduction caused the segmentation of the Farallon Plate,
cessation of subduction, and the formation of a transverse boundary between the Pacific
and North American plates [@Atwater1970]. Landward of this transverse boundary, a
gap in the slab formed in which upwelling asthenosphere gathered beneath the crust
[@Thorkelson1989]. South of this evolving Mendocino slab window, the Farallon slab
was broken into a series of microplates which rotated clockwise before stalling
during the early Miocene.
These features of the Neogene tectonic setting of Salinia inform two models
for the composition of its mantle lithosphere.

The total and blockwise offset along the North American--Pacific plate boundary is well-constrained
by paleomagnetic and geodynamic data augmented with the coupling of the locations of
Neogene volcanic centers to slab windows [@Wilson2005]. Reconstruction of slip on
outboard members of the San Andreas system (particularly the San Gregorio--Hosgri Fault)
using geologic markers [@Dickinson2005] gives matching results to within ~5 km.
Crystal Knob can be restored for Neogene offset to a location ~350 km SE
of its current location, with ~310 km
displacement of Salinia on the modern San Andreas Fault and ~40 km on the Rinconada fault
within the Salinian block \figp{context}.

A 100 km discrepancy between positions of batholithic features in the southern Sierra Nevada
and Salinian block still exists after accounting for these offsets, requiring pre-Neogene offset
of or within Salinia [@Wilson2005;@Dickinson2005].
We believe that the early Miocene restoration of Salinia \figp{reconstruction} represents
its configuration since the late Cretaceous--Paleocene. In this framework, the
mismatch between Salinia and the southern Sierras is
related to the late-Cretaceous disaggregation of the southern California arc
and northward extrusion of batholithic rocks [@Chapman2012]
and that the apparent rotation of the Sierra Nevada-Tehachapi extension is a recent
feature of thrust shortening [@Hall2013].
Therefore, unlike @Dickinson2005, we do not attempt to unrotate the
Sierra Nevada-Tehachapi "tail" to correct this discrepancy.

The Nacimiento fault is not given special treatment in this reconstruction
despite pre-Neogene sinistral slip of up to 500 km that has been proposed by
some workers [@Dickinson2005;@Jacobson2010]. An origin as a subduction megathrust
in a low-angle subduction system is more representative of the geologic data [@Hall2013].
In either case, the Nacimiento block has been tectonically coupled to the Salinian block
since the late Cretaceous [@Dickinson1983]. Moreover, recent detrital zircon
constraints on the source locale of the metaclastic rocks in the Nacimiento block
point to its formation off of southern California,
precluding sinistral strike-slip [@Chapman2016].

Outboard elements of the subduction system can also be restored:
@Wilson2005 shows that the Monterey microplate was originally located ~250 km south of
Crystal Knob and Salinia, and was translated to its current position offshore of
these features by ~155 km of slip on the San Gregorio--Hosgri fault during the
late Miocene [@Dickinson2005], plus ~100 km of earlier offshore dextral offset,
dominantly channeled along the paleo-subduction interface [@Wilson2005].

Reconstruction of this Neogene tectonic history shows that the
Salinian block was a marginal extension of the
Mojave province prior to being offset along the San Andreas system.
Salinia, along with Crystal Knob,
restores to a location above the center of the Mendocino slab window which
evolved during the early Neogene \figp{reconstruction}, and the current
juxtaposition of the province with the Monterey microplate arose in the middle
Miocene (~16-12 Ma).
The "slab window" and "stalled slab" hypotheses fit into this framework as two
potential mechanisms for the origin of the mafic lithosphere underplated beneath
Salinia. Both scenarios have been developed at length in the literature.

### Slab window

During the late stages of subduction from 30-10 Ma, Crystal Knob
resided in the center of the expanding slab window to the southwest of the
Mendocino Fracture Zone [@Atwater1998]. Within this zone, upwelling
asthenospheric mantle came into contact with the cool forearc lithosphere.
This event broadly drove a large pulse of non-arc
volcanism in coastal California [@Cole1995;@Wilson2005].
This volcanism is prominent in the Salinia/Nacimiento tectonic unit near Crystal Knob:
Oligocene to mid-Miocene volcanic centers such as the Morro Rock/Islay Hills complex [@Stanley2000]
and the Cambria Felsite [@Ernst1974]  are thought to be products
of ridge subduction and slab window formation.
It is possible that the ascent of asthenosphere into the slab window drove
large-scale replacement of the sub-Salinia mantle lithosphere [@Groome2009].

### Stalled slab

Another option proposed for the underplated sub-Salinian mantle lithosphere
is that it represents a partially subducted "stalled slab". Relict slabs are observed
as high-density anomalies in seismic imagery elsewhere in the Cordillera [@Schmandt2011;@Wang2013]
and are generally associated with deep slab breakoff during the final stages of
a subducting margin. The position of the offshore Monterey microplate
remnant outboard of Salinia \figp{context} provides the context for this theory.
However, older generations of stalled slabs underplated early in subduction are
potentially more likely.

#### Monterey plate: a young stalled slab?
The canonical case of stalled-slab underplating is underplating by
a partially-subducted extension of the Monterey microplate.
When the East Pacific Rise first reached the North American plate at
28.5 Ma, the Monterey microplate broke from the Farallon slab and
subducted independently until 19.5 Ma, while rotating clockwise with respect
to the Pacific plate [@Wilson2005]. The remnant slab has been
integrated into the Pacific plate and still forms part of the abyssal
seafloor \figp{context}. Some workers have invoked a stalled slab
attached to the Pacific Plate and extending as far eastward as the
Central Valley to correspond with the Isabella seismic anomaly
[@tenBrink1999; @Pikser2012; @Wang2013].
<!-- The presumed location of the slab has been noted to correspond to the creeping
section of the San Andreas fault [@Pikser2012].-->
This geometry implies a shallowly dipping transform system beneath Salinia and,
inland, the lateral translation of a steeply-dipping slab through the lithosphere
and asthenosphere beneath the North American plate to match the motion
of the San Andreas fault zone.
If this slab extends eastward as described, it would form the
bulk of the mantle lithosphere beneath Salinia and Crystal Knob.

The Monterey Plate hypothesis relies tenuously on the assertions that (1) the
mafic mantle lithosphere beneath Salinia is continuous with the observed plate remnant
and (2) that the Isabella seismic anomaly is a signature of a stalled slab.
There are problems with both of these assertions.

First, the depth at which the
Monterey plate slab broke after the cessation of
subduction is unknown. There is significant
ambiguity in seismic reflection data as to whether the high-density layer underlying Salinia
is continuous with the outboard Monterey plate.
The partially subducted slab is clearly visible in offshore seismic surveys [@Trehu1991;@Nicholson1992].
Workers differ on how to interpret an apparent dislocation near the current coastline,
with oceanic material dipping eastward at 16º offshore and abruptly flattening
to 2º beneath the coast (Figure \ref{fig:neogene_sections} gives the rough configuration).
Some interpret this data to show a single continuous slab
[@Brocher1999;@tenBrink1999;@Wijk2001;@Pikser2012;@Wang2013].
However, the available data is consistent with imbrication of oceanic material [@Trehu1991] and
a shallow slab tear adjacent to previously underplated material, at the approximate
location of the coastline [@Wilson2005].
Moreover, the 2º eastward dips of the underplated layer do not appear as steep
as a stalled subduction zone would suggest.

A more serious objection to a continuous stalled slab beneath Salinia
is that the proposed lateral translation of the slab is kinematically untenable.
Subduction and rotation of the Monterey plate occurred ~250 km south
of the Salinian block. A dangling slab extending eastward beneath Salinia would
have to retain its structure while being translated laterally through the sub-North America
asthenosphere with the movement of the San Andreas fault.
A young stalled slab requires mechanical dragging through the asthenosphere, which
is unlikely, particularly for a young (and thus thin and mechanically weak) slab.
Mechanical models of the system call for depths of slab tearing between
40 and 50 km [@Burkett2009;@Pikser2012]. A continuous Monterey plate
would have to extend far deeper and more inland.

There is some evidence that the Monterey plate resisted breakoff
for a time, rotating clockwise in concert with incipient transverse
motion on the plate boundary.
This torque localized on the plate boundary led to major effects on
crustal structure. The clockwise rotation of the Transverse Ranges and
outer continental borderland of southern California occurred atop of and in concert with
the rotation of the Monterey microplate [@Ward1991;@Nicholson1994].
However, the cessation of crustal-block rotations in the early Miocene suggests that traction
of the dragging slab ceased when the locus of transverse motion jumped inland
of the trench interface. This suggests that the end of microplate
rotation coincided with a shallow breakoff of the Monterey-plate slab.

Some workers have invoked the Isabella anomaly, a 300 km deep seismic high-velocity
zone underlying the southeast Central Valley, as a signature of a
stalled slab extending far inland [@Wijk2001;@Pikser2012;@Wang2013].
However, this anomaly
dwarfs the scale of the Monterey plate and requires it to project 300 km inland from the
subduction interface \figp{monterey_plate}. Further, xenolith studies, late-Cenozoic
volcanism, thermo-mechanical modeling, and epeirogenic transients have
demonstrated the likely formation of the Isabella anomaly by
delamination of a dense crustal root underlying the Sierra Nevada
Batholith [@Ducea1996;@Saleeby2003;@Saleeby2012]. Such evidence calls into
question the major justification of a large-scale stalled slab. Still,
the depth and eastern extent of the Monterey Plate is an open question.
Crystal Knob is located 120 km inboard of the relict trench. If the
Monterey microplate does indeed extend eastward, the slab may be sampled
by the Crystal Knob xenoliths.

### An older stalled slab

The idea that a stalled slab forms the basement of Salinia is not necessarily
limited to the case of the Monterey plate. A stalled slab could have formed prior
to this last gasp of subduction. Prior to the formation of a transverse margin
in the Neogene, Salinia formed the upper plate of a subduction megathrust since
at least the Cretaceous [@Chapman2016;@Hall2013]. This configuration provided
ample opportunities for the accretion of oceanic lithosphere beneath Salinia
in response to slab rollback and foundering. This possibility of older underplated
mantle lithosphere has been alluded to as a better explanation for apparent
dislocations in seismic data [@Trehu1991].

#### Thermal considerations

The slab window model for Salinian underplating is simpler than
a stalled-slab model,
with shallow slab breakoff of the Monterey microplate and mantle
upwelling in the resulting void [@Wilson2005].
The slab window model seems to offer a simpler explanation for the
array of geodynamic data and Neogene tectonic history explored above.
However, one of the motivations of the stalled slab model is that
its thermal implications are more realistic than those of the slab window model.

Though volcanism in the Coast Ranges has been tied to the migrating slab
window, its volume and intensity has not been consistent with other
episodes of shallow asthenospheric upwelling in the Cordillera
[@Humphreys1995].
One puzzle with the slab window model has been the relative lack
of volcanism in the forearc, the apparent continuity of a mafic layer
from the subducted oceanic crust inland, and the
eastward-dipping nature of the Moho in regional seismic surveys.
The stalled slab model has the feature of shielding the bottom of the continental
crust from the high-temperature asthenosphere [@Brocher1999].
Thermal modeling (based on heat-flow data) shows that a young stalled slab explains
the thermal structure of the Coast Ranges and Great Valley better than
the slab window model [@Erkan2008].

Older generations of stalled slab material may be an option.
Density contrast of an old plate would be limited [@Wang2013].

[[neogene_sections|figure]]
[[cross_sections|figure]]


The slab window seems to better fit the geodynamic and tectonic data. However, one
of the major reasons for its attractiveness

Whether the migrating slab window caused wholesale replacement of underlying
mantle lithosphere has been examined by several workers. @Erkan2008 examined the possibility
of wholesale ML replacement with upwelling asthenosphere, against a possible "stalled slab".
They concluded the stalled slab was more likely. We agree with their primary assertion against the
upwelling asthenosphere, but think that lithospheric nappes explain the data elegantly.


subducting slab or asthenospheric material underplated during a
slab window event [@Wijk2001]. <!--better references needed -->

Regardless of whether this rock was emplaced at the last gasp of subduction,
it is unlikely that the rock is part of the Monterey Plate proper, because this
would imply that the 150 km of slip on the San Gregorio -- Hosgri fault is not
continuous into the mantle {fig:cross-sections}.


<!-- - Sharp truncation of lower crust at Moho has been observed for years -->

We don't really have too much of an idea exactly how far the trench was offshore
pre-Neogene

### Late Cretaceous rollback underplating

A third scenario that hasn’t been explored significantly in the geodynamics literature:

- Late-Cretaceous breakup of southern-California arc
- Associated with subduction of Farallon plate
- Continental underplating by remnant Farallon slab recorded in Mojave [@Luffi2009]
- This goes along with subduction channel facies (Rand schist) exposed at the surface in the Mojave

At these locations, @Luffi2009 identified underplated nappes of Farallon-plate
mantle lithosphere. The timing and character of
underplating is constrained by surface exposures of the Pelona and Rand
schists, subduction-channel facies that mark a relict plate interface
during flat-slab subduction [@Chapman2010]. Taken together, crustal
structure and xenoliths show that the Farallon mantle lithosphere was
underplated during extensional collapse in the late Cretaceous to
Paleocene. <!--The timing and geometry of flat-slab subduction strongly
suggests that this episode directly induced the inland Laramide orogeny
[@Liu2010]. -->

When restored for Neogene transform offset, the Crystal Knob xenoliths
provide a distal addition to the lithospheric mantle transect anchored
by the Dish Hill and Cima Dome xenolith suites in the Mojave
\figref{reconstruction}.
The Salinian block is a displaced fragment of the Mojave block
[@Johnson1974], so it should not be surprising that similar surface
features are observed. Subduction channel facies are likewise juxtaposed
against arc plutonic rocks.
This relationship is particularly impressive in the case of the Sierra
de Salinas schist, which is exposed near the granites of the Santa Lucia
range. Geochemical markers of age and magma source (e.g. U-Pb ages and
\ce{{87}^Sr/{86}^Sr} ratios) imply that the plutons have a similar origin to Mojave [@Dickinson2005].

The repetition of the pattern of schist underplated against deep
plutonic rocks within the Salinian block implies formation
during the same flat-slab episode that disturbed the Mojave [@Kidder2006].
Accordingly, replacement of the mantle lithosphere
beneath inland locales implies that the same process acted in the
forearc.

Absent wholesale replacement due to later events, it is likely
that the sub-Salinia mantle lithosphere is largely composed of
Farallon-plate remnants.
This series of events that led to underplating has much more geologic justification

In Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections} we present an endmember model for Farallon plate mantle
lithosphere having tectonically underplated the Salinia-Mojave segment
of the Cordilleran batholithic belt at ca. 70 Ma. This is shown to have
occurred in conjunction with shallow flat subduction that was induced by
the subduction of a major oceanic plateau that was embedded in the
Farallon plate (after Saleeby, 2003; Liu et al., 2010). Crustal
deformation, timing and thermal conditions, as applied to our thermal
modeling (Fig. Y), are integrated from Kidder and Ducea (2007) and
Chapman et al. (2010). Figure Xa and Xb show the arrival of the oceanic
plateau into the subducting trench, and plateau buoyancy driven
shallowing of the subduction megathrust. Temperature conditions along
the flat subduction megathrust initiated at \~900ºC, ambient conditions
within the deep levels of the then-active arc, and retrogressed to
\~715ºC, peak temperatures recorded in shallowly subducted metaclastic
rocks of the Rand-Sierra de Salinas schist [@Kidder2006].

In Figures \ref{fig:cross_sections}c and d we adopt
the focused slab rollback and mantle lithosphere underplating models of
@Saleeby2003 and @Luffi2009 for the dynamic response of
normal thickness oceanic lithosphere following the crustal thickened
oceanic plateau down the subduction zone. Principal crustal responses
are shown as large magnitude trench-directed extension coupled to
extrusion of the Rand-Sierra de Salinas schist, which was driven by
suction forces of the retreating slab. In the Figure
\ref{fig:cross_sections}c to d transition,
accelerated rollback is accomplished by duplex formation from Farallon
plate mantle nappes. The idealized locus of mantle xenolith entrainment
by the Crystal Knob eruption is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections}d.
The approximate age
of oceanic lithosphere entering the trench is denoted along the base of
the oceanic crust in each frame [after @Seton2012]. This is
considered an endmember model in terms of the maximum plausible age of
mantle tectonic underplating, and the highest plausible upper plate
geothermal gradient.

### Reheating of older stalled-slab material

We know that the slab window must have been present. We know that a young
stalled slab, though more thermally favorable, is kinematically impossible.
And an older stalled slab is by itself too cold. But with reheating by the
slab window, it might be warmer.


### Random stuff

<!-- What do we do about the fact that the Farallon-plate scenario would
imply that the samples were in the mantle lithosphere ~100 km from the
arc and above a subduction interface (which is presumably relatively
cold)? This seems to make things a lot tougher to model. -->

<!-- Potential alternative implementation of forearc geotherm: heat-flow
emanating from top of half-space model + frictional heating on
fault...though this does have some problems -->


<!-- ## Quality of depth constraints -->
<!-- Regardless of the precision of the defined geothermal scenarios, the
lack of a high-quality, independent depth constraint is a major
limitation on the use of xenoliths to constrain the mantle lithosphere
geotherm. Pressure estimates provided by the Ca-in-olivine geobarometer
are of low quality, with large-magnitude errors and predictions below
the maximum stability depth of spinel peridotites. Careful analysis in
light of more certain data must be undertaken to determine to what use,
if any, the Ca-in-olivine geobarometer can be put. -->

<!-- ## Host basalt petrology

Further study of the host basalt can yield valuable information about
its interaction with the xenoliths. K-Ar dating is in progress on
plagioclase feldspar separates to determine the age of eruption within
the Pliocene--Pleistocene. Petrography and major-element analysis of
dunite cumulates could help to determine the fractionation history of
the magma, and thermobarometry applied to the basalt could enhance
controls on xenolith entrainment depth. -->
