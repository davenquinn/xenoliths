## From Crystal Knob section

Petrographic features and the presence of phenocrysts recording multiple stages
of magmatic enrichment suggest that the Crystal
Knob material experienced a multiphase history of fractional crystallization.
The Crystal Knob basalt contains fragments (both single-crystal
and lithic aggregates) entrained from the lithospheric mantle and dunite cumulates.
The phenocrysts record a compositional progression that indicates precipitation during
multiple stages of fractionation.

## Question about higher-T cohort - geochemical differences

I raise the question here, for later possible application, can the
differences exhibited in the higher-T chort be derived from the
interaction of underlying younger convective mantle-ie. slab window. If
not definitive, is the question worth raising-maybe ask Paul?
