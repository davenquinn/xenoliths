- The 1.65 Ma Crystal Knob volcanic pipe hosts xenoliths
  that sample the deep mantle lithosphere near the California coast
- Spinel peridotites equilibrated near ~1000ÂºC at depths between 45 and 75 km,
  and show a signature of deep melt interaction
- Model geotherms for Cretaceous-underplated mantle lithosphere
  and deep slab window heating best fit xenolith thermobarometry
