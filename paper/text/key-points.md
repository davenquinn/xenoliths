- The 1.65 Ma Crystal Knob volcanic pipe hosts xenoliths that sample the deep
  mantle lithosphere near the California coast
- Spinel peridotites equilibrated near 1000ÂºC at depths between 45 and 75 km,
  and show a signature of deep melt interaction
- The mantle lithosphere beneath the Coast Ranges was tectonically underplated
  during the Cretaceous and heated by the Neogene slab window
