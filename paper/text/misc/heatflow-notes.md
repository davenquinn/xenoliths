<!-- (somewhere near the beginning of this section we need a very explicit
statement of what the heat flow data are, what the anomalies are, what
is CRTA, and how these data have been interpreted-remember, very few of
our readers will be familiar with these data, and potentially our most
critical reviewers will be very familiar with these data, and their
current interpretation. Here is a comment on Erkan and Blackwell that we
should incorporate into our qualitative analysis, I leave it to you to
fit it into this section in your logical progression, and wording: -->

They corner themselves into needing special circumstances to explain
CRTA like rapid recent uplift (which could be a contributing
factor @Ducea2003b), shear heating or thermal
relaxation of stalled slab nonsense, just because they insist on the low
heat flow from the Great Valley-Sierra Nevada to be caused by a stalled
slab-classic circular reasoning. We need to go on the offensive here.
Thermal relaxation of a young stalled slab would not be much
different than a deep slab window. Low heat flow values under the entire
GV-SN are irrespective of where plate reconstructions show slab windows
or (Monterey) microplates, but map out very close to the distribution of
where Mesozoic mantle wedge/continental mantle lithosphere is still
intact beneath the crust. Compare E & B’s figure 1 map with the
structure contours that I added to Figure 3 for the Isabella anomaly as
well as the symbolism for the adjacent SE Sierra region that has lost
its mantle lithosphere. The structure contours show just the deeper part
of the anomaly, leaving lots of additional cool Mesozoic mantle
lithosphere beneath the Great valley to axial Sierra Nevada making the
correlation with E & B’s figure 1 pattern tighter. Then we can now layer
on what we know about lithosphere–scale heat production in the Sierra
Nevada from @Brady2006. I also email to you our “Epi II” paper on delamination which
has a helpful section on SN heat flow, right column, pg. 404). Bottom
line is that GV-SN heat flow, except where mantle lithosphere has
delaminated, reflects a relict Late Cretaceous geotherm developed during
extended flat slab subduction at the time or arc cessation. Crystal Knob
and Coyote Lake, in the Coast Ranges clearly show that there IS recent
upwelling under the Coast Ranges, not to mention the Clear Lake volcanic
field. E and B have about every aspect of their interpretation wrong,
but we should be careful and constructive in our criticism of their
work, for their data is very useful.
