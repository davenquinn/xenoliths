## Outline

- Xenoliths have been important for diagnosing arc evolution
- Crystal Knob is the most outboard yet characterized
- Use it to shed light on some of the features of Salinia
- Erupted into Nacimiento block (but Nacimiento has moved as unit with Salinia in the Neogene) : Scott Johnson
- Restores outboard of Mojave
    - both plate-circuit [@Wilson2005] and restoration of San Gregorio – Hosgri fault [@Dickinson2005] give the same answer to within 5 km
Scott Johnson + Chapman et al 2015

The fact that this is west of the Salinian block proper is not a problem
because the Nacimiento fault is a Cretaceous subduction thrust structure
(of accretionary wedge under continental margin).
In fact, this demonstrates that the slab was at < 100 km depth at this
time and place (maybe).

Nacimiento fault is sinistral at last gasp? Or thrust?

The offshore Monterey plate and Pacific plate outliers (Gualala block, point Reyes)
was translated northwards on the San Gregorio -- Hosgri
fault relative to the Salinian block + Franciscan complex, by 150 km.
This puts the locale of the xenoliths well into the slab window gap (@Wilson2005).
This is further borne out by the proximity to Miocene volcanic centers such as the
Morro Rock – Islay Hills volcanic complex and the Cambria Felsite,
which are part of the same overall crustal block (slightly east of the SGH fault)
and thought to be remnants of slab-window volcanism.

At what point in time did this mantle lithosphere become part of North America? is the salient
question here

# Did slab window cause wholesale underplating?

show that the Crystal Knob xenoliths
are from the depleted mantle, allowing
the immediate rejection of a sub-Salinian mantle derived from arc residues or other continental
material.
Several scenarios have been proposed for the deep basement structure of the Salinian block.

These results are consistent with all considered scenarios
(Farallon, Monterey, and slab-window) for mantle lithosphere origin.


Either young subducted mantle lithosphere or older subducted mantle lithosphere
plus some amount of heating from below (slab gap) are sufficient to explain the
observations

If the plate broke at a shallow depth or near the trench, we could be in an environment
with upwelling

Question: what generation of the downgoing slab does Crystal Knob represent ?

In Monterey plate scenario, dextral slip on both the San Andreas fault zone and San Gregorio -- Hosgri
fault zone were transferred eastward along a shallow paleo-subduction channel, enabling the downgoing plate
to retain integrity as a "dangling slab." In this case, the sub-Salinia mantle
lithosphere in the vicinity of Crystal Knob would represent the downdip equivalent
of the Monterey plate directly offshore.


- Sutured grain boundaries
- Symplectite

# Discussion

A key question for the origin of the sub-Salinia mantle lithosphere is what

- Monterey Plate continuous through

Why not modeling underplated material beneath crustal section?
- Geometry and timing of subduction stepbacks are fraught, but evidence shows
  one major rollback event that can be represented

# Geotherm too cold for slab-window underplating


# Tectonic underplating

Easy explanation of "mismatch discrepancy" in @Dickinson2005, Figure 14, panel B:
Restoring SAFZ offsets plus rotation of the Sierra Nevada-Tehachapi "tail" leaves
a 100 km mismatch between the expected position of batholithic rocks in the Sierran
tail. This discrepancy can be resolved with the implication that the westward
translation of the Sierran tail happened prior to any SAFZ offset (i.e. possibly
in the Cretaceous). Restoration for @Dickinson2005 does not attempt to restore this
discrepancy.

Still missing ~100 km of offset (Monterey plate is offset ~630 km on plate boundary),
while total offset accounted for on SAFZ, Rinconada, and Hosgri faults is ~500 km.
Perhaps this is

Seismic studies have recognized that the California margin is underplated
by a mafic layer at ~30 km depth, corresponding to the Moho [@Trehu1991].
This layer dips gently eastward at regional scale.
The source of this underplated mafic layer has been debated:
is it a slab window or a stalled slab?

# Slab window case is too hot

This makes sense because other instances of shallow underplating, such as the
Basin and Range, have much more voluminous volcanism and high modern geotherms.
Major active volcanic centers and geothermal fields.


- Could be Monterey plate (interface would be at \~ this depth at this
  distance in front of the arc
- Equally, could be old Farallon plate with some amount of heating from below

# Possible other figures

- Some other geochemical charts
- Plot of oceanic crust ages (taken from @Liu2010 at the moment, without visual representation)

# Geochemistry

- More reducing: equilibrium should tend to favor Eu in Cpx
Some are more fertile than abyssal peridotites
CK-5 is essentially like primitive mantle

"Hot" samples show strong metasomatism in hockey-stick plots
This is especially clear in Whole rock analysis

There is clearly some disequilibrium partitioning between clinopyroxene
and orthopyroxene for REEs, giving rise to strong Eu anomalies.

CK-6 is rich in ferric iron: Needs some modal compositions to test this

## Lu enrichment

- Things are enriched in Lu - seems weird
- Paul says wouldn't mention

Higher thermal diffusivity would cause temperature distribution to be "flattened out"
more quickly. Thus, lower temperatures would be predicted.

## Granite heat generation

Extra heat would have dominantly came from latent heat of crystallization.

@Vila2010 - ~2 uW/m3
@Bea2012 - ~2 uW/m3 for granite is reasonable

Increased temperature in Farallon scenario is result of latent heat of
crystallization of granite.

## Model bottom constraint

There are no reliable estimates of the mantle heat flux that cover the model
domain, and the thermal environment for underplated mantle lithosphere is complicated
by the presence of a subducting slab below the model domain at some depth. The model
is run to great depth to avoid any influence on the surface geotherm. However,
Farallon and forearc scenarios can be treated as maximum temperatures because of
the influence of the overriding slab.
