# Crystal Knob Presentation

## Introduction

- Xenoliths have been important for diagnosing arc evolution
- Crystal Knob is the most outboard yet characterized
- Use it to shed light on some of the features of Salinia
- Erupted into Nacimiento block (but Nacimiento has moved as unit with Salinia in the Neogene) : Scott Johnson 
- Restores outboard of Mojave
    - both plate-circuit [@Wilson2005] and restoration of San Gregorio – Hosgri fault [@Dickinson2005] give the same answer to within 5 km

## Petrology

### Abyssal peridotites
- Range of depletion in major and trace elements
- Isotopically depleted
    - εNd of +10, Sr/Sr of .702
    - no contribution from the western North American crust

### Trace elements
- CK-6 (hottest sample) is enriched despite trace-element history of LREE depletion and re-enrichment
- Clinopyroxene Eu anomalies: possibly a signature of ghost plagioclase
- Not a geochemically homogenous set of samples, even though they likely originated from same mantle source
- Looks like MOR depletion patterns followed by re-enrichment

### Major-element temperature
- Temperature: two groups with gradient in temperature
- Higher/cooler, lower/deeper

### Rare-earth temperature
- Deeper samples are refertilized in LREE
    - Over and above amount of LREE in higher samples
    - Interacted with fertile fluid, but not enough to re-equilibrate major elements
- CK-4 records a significantly higher temperature for LREE
    - metasomatic processes
    - re-equilibrated at lower T?

Fossil heating event affecting CK-4 LREE. This is not the most recent perturbation because it's not reflected in the major element thermometers

### Depth constraints
- Ca-in-olivine barometry
    - Seem to be sourced from relatively deep in the spinel stability field
    - Scatter towards shallower depths reflects late-stage diffusion

- Implies higher geothermal gradient than 95 mW/m^2
    - This has been observed before, matches well with seismic constraints and modeling
    - “Coast Range Thermal Anomaly”

## Tectonic scenarios

- Sharp truncation of lower crust at Moho has been observed for years
- Several scenarios have been proposed for the deep basement structure of the Salinian block.
Let’s see how we can fit this into that context:

### Slab window

- Ridge subduction and initiation of transverse motion in Neogene
- Clear that this must have had a sizable influence on the region
- Morro/Islay, Cambria Felsite

It’s hard to explain low heat flows with this model

### Stalled slab

- Stalled, remnant slab from the final stages of subduction
- Relict plate exists offshore
- Must have been translated several hundred km north
    - beneath San Andreas or at minimum San Gregorio – Hosgri fault

Thermal modeling (based on heat-flow data) shows that this better explains thermal structure of the Coast Ranges and Great Valley [@Erkan2008]

- Kinematically hard to swallow due to lack of a signature of lateral translation through mantle

### Late Cretaceous rollback underplating

A third scenario that hasn’t been explored significantly in the geodynamics literature:

- Late-Cretaceous breakup of southern-California arc
- Associated with subduction of Farallon plate
- Continental underplating by remnant Farallon slab recorded in Mojave [@Luffi2009]
- This goes along with subduction channel facies (Rand schist) exposed at the surface in the Mojave

Similar features are observed in Salinia
- Arc plutonic rocks
- Subduction channel facies

## Thermal modeling

- Model setups  corresponding to tectonic scenarios
- Model the relaxation of the geotherm during subduction and underplating

### Setups

- Global Depth and Heat model for oceanic crust
- Forearc geotherm model [@Royden1993]
- Standard values for oceanic and continental material properties
- We ignore the effects of a downgoing slab below
    - may be significant over long timescales
    - will generally serve only to cool geotherms

## Results

- Slab window is really hot!
- Farallon plate and older forearc are really cold
    - Converging on “steady-state” value
- Farallon heated from below seems to work well
