Talked to Paul Asimow and Jon Blundy: interesting sidebar to REE thermometry
of @Liang2013. We can see a distinct disequilibrium in Europium in a few samples
(CK-2 and and CK-3) favoring Eu in orthopyroxene by a factor of 10. This suggests
that there is a different partition coefficient $D$ for Eu than other REEs, which
is not in line with the usual equilibrium pattern for REEs. This in turn suggests
that a significant amount of Eu 2+ exists in these samples (so, a much more
reducing environment in general). Eu, because of its two oxidation states,
can behave differently depending on the redox conditions of the sample.

However, in searching with Jon Blundy, we haven't been able to find any experiments
in the literature that exhibit quite these effects. Everything shows a higher Cpx/Opx
partition coefficient than the rest of the REEs for situations that might be
more reduced.

Sr can be used as a substitute for Eu(2+) in partition-coefficient calculations:
It has basically the same ionic radius and same valence state as Eu(2+). Looking
at these, they show basically the same (higher) D_Eu that is expected. But we
would expect negative values based on CK-2 and CK-3.

Aina Torres: EU and Sr anomalies in Plagioclase

To see negative anomalies in Eu for Cpx/Opx, we need to look at wet/cold
pyroxene compositions.

Run 1949 of Adam and Green 2006: no Europium, but Strontium:
Sm .27, .011 = 25
- Sr 45
Gd .4, .03 = 13
High pressure basanite

Look at magnesian andesites with two pyroxenes and lots of water

Can use Sr as a proxy for Eu(3+) because it's the same ionic radius as
Green et al. - big positive anomaly

If all Eu was divalent, positive effect would be huge

McDade et al
Sm .373/21 17
Sr 17 also - no difference between Sm and Eu 3+ partition coeffs

Gaetani et al didn't do opx

D_Sr - .13 / .0021 = 62
D_Nd .198 = 16

D_Sm: 5
D_Sr: 7

Blundy and Brooker:

Need a clinopyroxene where D_Sr is incredibly low.
Low-temperature, low pressure, pretty wet
