	In Figure X we present an endmember model for Farallon plate mantle lithosphere having tectonically underplated the Salinia-Mojave segment of the Cordilleran batholithic belt at ca. 70 Ma. This is shown to have occurred in conjunction with shallow flat subduction that was induced by the subduction of a major oceanic plateau that was embedded in the Farallon plate (after Saleeby, 2003; Liu et al., 2010). Crustal deformation, timing and thermal conditions, as applied to our thermal modeling (Fig. Y), are integrated from Kidder and Ducea (2007) and Chapman et al. (2010). Figure Xa and Xb show the arrival of the oceanic plateau into the subducting trench, and plateau buoyancy driven shallowing of the subduction megathrust. Temperature conditions along the flat subduction megathrust initiated at ~900C, ambient conditions within the deep levels of the then active arc, and retrogressed to ~715C, peak temperatures recorded in shallowly subducted metaclastic rocks of the Rand-Sierra de Salinas schist. In Figures Xc and d we adopt the focused slab rollback and mantle lithosphere underplating models of Saleeby (2003) and Luffi et al. (2009) for the dynamic response of normal thickness oceanic lithosphere following the crustal thickened oceanic plateau down the subduction zone. Principal crustal responses are shown as large magnitude trench-directed extension coupled to extrusion of the Rand-Sierra de Salinas schist, which was driven by suction forces of the retreating slab. In the Figure Xc to d transition accelerated rollback is accomplished by duplex formation from Farallon plate mantle nappes. The idealized locus of mantle xenolith entrainment by the Crystal Knob eruption is shown in Figure Xd.  The approximate age of oceanic lithosphere entering the trench is denoted along the base of the oceanic crust in each frame (after Seton et al. 2012). This is considered an endmember model in terms of the maximum plausible age of mantle tectonic underplating, and the highest plausible upper plate geothermal gradient. 
Go onto thermal modeling results for this scenario using thermal gradient that gives 715C at 30 km, and underplating of 50 m.y. old oceanic lithosphere at 75 Ma……

Then use “typical forearc” geotherm to generate a family of cooling trajectories that successively model the subduction of:
40 m.y. lithosphere at 60 Ma
30 m.y.    “ at 50 Ma
20 m.y.   “ at 40 Ma
10 m.y.  “  at 30 Ma,  this one we can equate to the Monterey plate scenario

Then finally,  your slab window model
