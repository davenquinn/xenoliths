The strength of these disequilibria suggests that a significant
amount of \ce{Eu^{2+}} exists in these samples and that it is strongly
partitioned between orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene. Moreover, the dataset
suggests an incorrect partition coefficient, with Eu favoring orthopyroxene at
a factor of up to 10. Since this disequilibrium exists between pyroxenes, it is
unlikely to correspond to fractionation into plagioclase, the usual source
Eu depletions in melt residues. However, this could be the case if quicker
diffusion of Eu out of clinopyroxenes is invoked, and the samples were never
fully equilibrated.
