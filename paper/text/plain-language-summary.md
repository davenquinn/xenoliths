The Crystal Knob volcanic neck is a small, deeply sourced lava that erupted
near in the California Coast Ranges 1.65 million years ago. It carried
xenoliths, hand-sized fragments of the mantle, which can help us understand
how the western edge of North America was formed from material accreted by
the subduction of the Farallon plate.
We focused on six samples of mantle material with different mineralogical
characteristics, which were all formed directly from the mantle,
independently from the rest of North America. Some xenoliths showed melt
extraction and many had additional material added, changing their composition
from pristine mantle. Mineral phases record their temperature
(950-1060 ÂºC) and depth  (45-75 km)
prior to eruption. This unique record the thermal state of the deep
mantle allows us to test several options for the formation
of the underpinnings of the central California coast. The most
viable option is that the mantle became part of North America ~75 million
years ago and was heated from below ~24 million years ago, by upwelling
associated with the end of Farallon-plate subduction. This history fits with
a large body of evidence that much of the structure of the California coast
is inherited from the Cretaceous period.
