The Crystal Knob volcanic neck is a small, deeply sourced lava that erupted
near in the California Coast Ranges 1.65 million years ago. It carried
xenoliths, hand-sized fragments of the mantle, which can help us understand how
the western edge of the North American continent was formed. We focused on six
samples from Crystal Knob with different mineralogical characteristics, which
were all brought up from the mantle. Their chemistry suggests that they were
not originally part of North America. Some xenoliths had been partially melted
and many had additional material added, changing their composition from
pristine mantle. Mineral phases record their temperature (950-1060 ÂºC) and
depth  (45-75 km) prior to eruption. This rare direct record of the temperature
of the upper mantle allows us to test several options for the formation of the
underpinnings of the central California coast. The most viable option is that
the mantle beneath the edge of North America was tectonically pushed under the
continent ~75 million years ago. It heated from below ~24 million years ago at
the end of Farallon-plate subduction. This history fits with extensive evidence
that much of the deep architecture of the California coast is inherited from
the Cretaceous period.
