## Petrography

<!-- (Daven, we should have a table that lists all samples, and gives a
petrographic overview) -->

The peridotite samples (CK-2 through CK-7) were texturally classified using
the scheme of @Pike1977. All samples display an allotriomorphic granular
texture with anisotropy largely absent. There are
no significant petrographically observed plastic deformation features
(e.g. kink domains in olivine grains) in any of the samples. However,
samples CK-2 and CK-5 exhibit a weak shape-preferred alignment in elongate
spinels.

Minor late-stage alteration products are seen in all peridotite samples.
This includes variably Fe-rich grain boundaries of major phases and Ti
enrichment in pyroxene rims (<10 µm from the grain
edge). Sample CK-4 contains an alteration channel which cuts linearly
across the thin section. This channel is bounded by resorbed boundaries
of the major phases (olivine and orthopyroxene) and hosts
microcrystalline clinopyroxene, 10 µm euhedral spinels,
and minor amphibole. Near this melt channel, thin streamers of
intergranular fill show compositions enriched in Na and Ti. These
fills are present (but less extensive) in sample CK-3, and
generally absent in other samples. Samples other than CK-3 and CK-4
largely do not show melt infiltration along grain boundaries, instead
having major phases in contact (though most are fractured along these surfaces).
All samples, but most notably CK-3 and CK-4, have clinopyroxene grains
that are strongly intergrown with orthopyroxene. <!-- check this
statement -->
Sample CK-7 shows abundant exsolution lamellae and graphic recrystallization of
orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene.

The peridotite samples were lithologically classified using recalculated whole-rock
mineral modes The samples range from lherzolites to clinopyroxene
harzburgites and are dominated by olivine and orthopyroxene. All samples
contain minor (<1%wt) spinel. CK-2 has the most fertile
composition, with 12.2%wt clinopyroxene. CK-3 is the least
fertile sample, with 0.91%wt clinopyroxene. Olivine modes range
from 65 to 75%wt. Grain size varies between samples but
generally has a characteristic scale of 200 µm. The
harzburgite CK-3 contains 2 mm orthopyroxene
porphyroblasts. All samples are Type I peridotites in the @Frey1978
classification system.

The host lava (CK-1)
is an alkali basalt with vesicles and abundant phenocrysts of plagioclase and
olivine, and less common clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene.
The sample also contain dunite and multiphase peridotite fragments
ranging from aggregates of a few grains to ~5 cm diameter.
The groundmass is dominated by altered glass and microcrystalline
plagioclase lathes.
Though dominantly black, it is mottled with slightly greenish grey color domains
at ~500 mm scale, which likely correspond to different levels of alteration.
These domains are cross-cut by elongate narrow (~1 mm) flow shear bands of
finer-grained material with few vesicles and phenocrysts.

Petrographic study of cumulate fragments within the Crystal Knob
basalt reveals residues from multiple stages of melt fractionation.
Samples CK-D1 and CK-D2 are dominated
by dunite and peridotite fragments up to 2 cm in diameter. The
peridotite fragments show textures similar to those in samples CK-2 to CK-7.
The dunites fragments are cumulate textured and finer-grained than the peridotites,
with characteristic grain sizes ranging from 50--200 µm for different fragments.
Intergranular melt inclusions <!-- now altered to ??? -->
are evident between olivine grains. Some cumulate material surrounds large (up to
2 mm) grains of olivine, spinel, and pyroxene (or multigrain aggregates of
these phases). CK-D1 notably contains a large spinel grain with a
pitted rim embedded in dunite.
The dunite cumulates in these samples are texturally representative of
the vast majority of xenoliths Crystal Knob basalt.

Overall, the Crystal Knob basalt contains fragments (both single-crystal
and lithic aggregates) corresponding to the mantle source and cumulates
from several stages of fractionation that were recycled into the magma.
<!-- This suggests evolution in several
deep magma chambers with entrainment of the wall rock

represent interactions with the melt throughout their history -->

## Major elements

<!--[[minerals]]-->
<!--[[lava_minerals]]-->
<!--[[major_elements]]-->

Whole-rock Mg\# (molar Mg/(Mg+Fe) $\cdot$ 100) ranges from 87 to 91. Within each
sample, a consistent Mg\# for all silicate phases is indicative of Fe-Mg
equilibrium. All samples contain <1%wt spinel. A range of
spinel Cr\# (molar Cr/(Cr+Al) $\cdot{}$ 100) from 10 to 27 likewise
implies variation in degree of partial melting between samples
[@Dick1984].

<!-- Sample CK-4 is the most depleted, with a distinct signature of melt
extraction -->

We correct spinel Mg\# from total iron to ferrous iron basis using stoichiometric
balance: excess Fe is removed from the octahedral site and added to the tetrahedral
until $\Sigma \textrm{cations} = 3$ with a 4-oxygen basis. This correction results
in spinel Mg\# between 75 and 81, slightly higher than the uncorrected value.

Major-element analysis of olivine phenocrysts in the
host lava shows
a well-sampled trendline from xenolith compositions (Mg#=0.89) through
progressively lower Mg# cumulate grains `Figure major_elements`.
Thus, olivine grains range from true phenocrysts to entrained
xenocrysts corresponding to the host peridotites
and various intermediate stages of magma evolution.
It is also clear that the melt fractionation history was relatively
complex. Zoned clinopyroxene grains show a stepwise crystallization
history in a progressively evolving magma \figref{cpx_profile}.
These features suggest a history of melt fractionation.

## Trace Elements

<!--[[spider]]-->

Clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and recalculated whole-rock rare-earth element show several modes of
variation between samples, corresponding to different amounts of
depletion and re-enrichment.
All samples show clear evidence of rare-earth element
depletion, although the amount of this depletion varies.
The cooler samples show progressive depletion in light rare-earth
elements (LREEs) and undepleted heavy rare-earths (HREEs). The warmer
samples show progressive HREE depletion and enrichment in LREEs. These
trends are inverted, so CK-4, the most HREE-depleted sample, is also the
most LREE-enriched.

<!-- Maybe this paragraph should go lower? --> This pattern suggests
that the cooler samples were depleted of (relatively more incompatible)
LREEs as residues of progressive fractional melting [@Johnson1990].
The warmer group of samples underwent a multistage history of
wholesale REE depletion (due to higher-degree melting) followed by later
LREE re-enrichment. This overprinting relationship is similar to that
observed in mid-ocean ridge peridotites, with ridge crest depletion
followed by off axis refertilization via infiltration of low-melt
fraction magmas [@Luffi2009]. However, this relationship may also have
arisen during melt extraction and entrainment prior <!--(confusing, do
you mean during eruption/entrainment here?)--> to eruption. The latter
seems to demand a significant residence time of the hotter xenoliths in,
or proximal to, a magma chamber at depth to allow LREE
refertilization.

## Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopes

<!--[[isotopes]]-->

Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd radiogenic isotope data for clinopyroxene separates show
these samples to be derived from the depleted convecting mantle. 
All xenolith samples are enriched in radiogenic \ce{^{143}Nd}
($\epsilon_{\textrm{Nd}}$ from 10.3 to 11.0) and depleted in
\ce{^{87}Sr} (\ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .702). This pattern of strong
depletion in large-ion-lithophile elements rules out a continental
lithosphere or Mesozoic mantle wedge source and suggests an origin in the
asthenospheric or underplated oceanic mantle
[@DePaolo1976b;@McCulloch1978].

## Thermometry

Electron-microprobe major-element data is used as the basis for pyroxene
Ca--exchange geothermometry. Several formulations of this reaction are
tested \tabref{thermometry}: BKN [@Brey1990] and TA98 [@Taylor1998] are
formulated based on empirical calibration of the two-pyroxene Ca exchange
reaction in simple and natural systems. @Taylor1998 is explicitly calibrated to
account for errors arising from high Al content.
The Ca-in-orthopyroxene (Ca-OPX) thermometer [@Brey1990] is formulated for
use in the absence of clinopyroxene.
Together, these thermometers can query the full range of major-element compositions
seen in the Crystal Knob dataset.

<!--[[thermometry]]-->

Core and rim measurements are separated to assess within-sample
temperature disequilibrium and late-stage (e.g. eruptive) heating. Analytical errors (caused by
uncertainty in microprobe data) are small, on the order of 5ºC (1$\sigma$).
Other sources of error include the calibration of the thermometer
and potential bias from within-sample disequilibrium. @Taylor1998
reports residuals of calibration of the thermometer to experimental
data which yield total errors of 50-60ºC (1$\sigma$). Unreported calibration errors for the
BKN and Ca-OPX thermometers are likely similar in scale. In practice,
error distributions based on calibration with heterogeneous experimental
samples likely form an upper bound on relative errors. Within-sample scatter in measured temperatures
can be used to estimate the relative error of the thermometer, and the relative
performance of different thermometers can be used to assess the recovery of absolute temperatures.

Per-sample temperature distributions are
constructed by calculating a separate temperature for each individual nearest-neighbor
pair of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene.
Analytical errors are propagated through the calculation.
The resulting distribution of temperatures (with *n* ranging from 19 to 74 pairs per
group) accounts for within-sample variations and provides an
approximation of measurement precision.

TA98 and BKN temperatures have a strong linear relationship, with BKN
temperature estimates higher by up to 50ºC.
The disparity decreases
towards higher temperatures and conforms to the relationship between
the two thermometers found by @Nimis2010.
This relationship can be expressed as
$\textrm{T}_\textrm{BKN} = 0.9~\textrm{T}_\textrm{TA98} + 145$ for temperatures
in ºC.
@Nimis2010 shows that TA98 performs well against
experimental results in several scenarios and advises its use over BKN.
The Ca-in-OPX thermometer generally yields results in between BKN and TA98,
with little within-sample scatter, possibly the result of fast diffusion
of small amounts of Ca in orthopyroxene. <!-- *** --->

Average TA98 temperatures range from 957 to 1063ºC for cores and
955 to 1054ºC for rims \tabp{thermometry}.
CK-2 core temperatures indicate more complete
equilibration, with a standard deviation of only 2.3ºC (compared
with 8.2-12.4ºC for all other samples). Temperatures are distributed roughly normally
for most samples, but outlying clusters of measurements in CK-4 and CK-6 may indicate
disequilibrium at millimeter scale.
In CK-4, a few grain cores with TA98
temperatures of 1100ºC are likely related to late-stage diffusion during
entrainment and eruption.
High and variable rim compositions may also be related to the eruption event.
Several samples show a wide spread rim temperatures, perhaps
indicating differential exposure to interstital fluids.
This internal variability is minor: for grain cores in all samples,
the mean of pairwise analyses is within a few degrees
of the temperature calculated by averaging all pyroxenes across the sample.
This implies that the bulk of the temperature signature
is based on the equilibrium state of the sample.

The samples show an apparent bimodal
distribution in equilibration temperature, forming distinct groups
centered at 970ºC and 1060ºC (TA98) \figref{temp_summary}.
The cooler group contains CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7, while the hotter
contains CK-3, CK-4, and CK-6.
This division between these two groups is robust and apparent in all thermometers.
The high-temperature samples show re-enrichment in LREEs and contain chromian spinels.
This temperature distribution may signify two distinct depths of origin for
the studied xenoliths. Throughout this paper, the samples are color-coded, with
blue-green corresponding to the low-temperature array, and red-yellow representing
the high-temperature samples.

### REE-in-pyroxene thermometry

We use the @Liang2013 REE-in-two-pyroxene thermometer to estimate the
equilibration temperature of the samples using an independent system.
The relative immobility of REEs allows assessment
of equilibrium temperatures over longer timescales than those queried
with two-pyroxene cation exchange thermometry.


- Calculate a per-element equilibrium temperature
- Best fitting line from zero through the data cloud gives sample
  equilibrium temperature

- Robust regression using a Tukey biweight norm


Sample CK-4 shows major disequilibrium in the light and medium REEs, with only
elements heavier than Ho retaining an equilibrium signature.

- In some samples, notably CK-3 and CK-4, LREE show much higher
  equilibration temperatures than HREE
- CK-4 had excess LREE added, causing re-equilibration of LREEs
- This occurred to a lesser extent with CK-3
- Change in temperature?
  - A fossil heating event that was retained due to the large size of LILE
- Due to kinetics of two thermometers, this must have happened before
  re-equilibration of major elements (right??)
- Change in partition coefficients due to other means
  - Some weird melt interaction favoring extraction of LREE from
    clinopyroxene and driving up relative abundance of LREE in
    orthopyroxene

- Europium disequilibrium
  - interesting sidebar to REE thermometry
  - distinct disequilibrium in Eu
  - favors Eu in Opx by a factor of 10
  - different partition coefficient for Eu
  - Eu, because of its two oxidiation states, can behave differently
  - suggests a significant amount of Eu 2+ exists in the samples
  - much more reducing environment in general (Asimow and Blundy,
    personal communication)

### Depth constraints

<!--[[depth]]-->

Peridotite barometers are based on the decreasing Al content of
orthopyroxene with depth [@Nickel1985; @Brey1990; @Nimis2000]. However, in
the absence of garnet, the reaction is purely thermometric, with nearly
vertical isopleths in P-T space [@Herzberg1978; @Gasparik2000]. With no
reliable geobarometers for spinel peridotites, several less robust
measures are used to evaluate the depth of the xenolith source.

Minimum entrainment depths must be greater than ~30 km, the depth of both the
Moho near the eruption site [@Trehu1991] and the plagioclase-spinel
peridotite facies transition
[@Green1970a]. The xenolith entrainment depth must exceed the boundary of spinel stability,
which is composition-dependent and poorly constrained for natural systems,
but thought to lie over the 50-80 km depth interval
[@ONeill1981; @Kinzler1997; @Gasparik2000; @Klemme2004].

<!--[[ree_temperatures]]-->

Projection of TA98 temperatures onto a geotherm using a surface heat
flux [@Turcotte2002] of 90 mW/m^2, corresponding to measured heat flows
in the study region [@Erkan2009] yields model depths ranging from 31-39
km \figref{depth}. However, the surface temperatures that the heat flow
data are based on may be transient.
<!-- could go into things here but may get into this later -->


The Coast Ranges are geologically active and may be affected by
geothermal and erosional processes. Recent increases in erosion such as
those documented post 2 Ma in the Santa Lucia Range [@Ducea2003b]
could significantly raise the geothermal gradient in the Coast Ranges.

The geothermal gradient may be affected by differences in regional thermal conductivity
@Lachenbruch1980 concluded that CRTA could not be generated by
conductive fault heating alone, but was also hesitant to invoke fluid
flow to explain a regionally averaged thermal gradient.
@Kennedy1997 shows the presence of mantle fluids in the San Andreas
fault zone, giving credence to the idea deep fluid transport.

All of these potential estimation effects for a geothermal gradient have
the effect of making it look more pronounced than it really is. Thus, it
seems likely that the gradients shown are a maximum limit on allowed
geothermal gradient.

<!-- This text in the parens is confusing, and needs to be more clearly written with some specific point in mind)) -->

Equilibration pressure measurements are attempted for the peridotite
xenoliths using the @Kohler1990 Ca-in-olivine
barometer. This barometer is explicitly calibrated for spinel
peridotites but widely disregarded based on poor resolution,
vulnerability to late-stage diffusion, and dependence on low Ca
concentrations in olivine [@Medaris1999; @OReilly1997].
This technique yields a broad distribution in model depths,
largely coincident with the spinel stability field \figref{depth}.
The low-temperature samples in particular have significant scatter
towards model depth below the spinel-in isograd.
The depth distributions are largely normal, with modes
ranging from 35 to 52 km.
The low and high-temperature cohorts remain separable, with high-temperature
samples generally showing deeper equilibrium depths.

To convert between depth and pressure, we assume a constant geobaric
gradient of 30 km/GPa.

<!-- This paragraph needs more -->
The Cr\# of the hotter samples expands the stability field of
spinel against garnet to deeper depths. Several studies have attempted to estimate
the magnitude of this effect [@Klemme2000; @Klemme2004; @ONeill1981].
Figure \ref{depth} shows the depth increases estimated by the
simplified method given in  @ONeill1981, showing that potential depths increase by up to
10 km. If these deeper depths are valid, the outlined
geotherm conforms generally to temperature bounds of 700--1100ºC
measured by seismic tomography at 50--100 km depth for coastal
California [@Goes2002].
<!-- This paragraph is confusing. It needs more explanation, and closer
ties to what is shown on Figure 14. Also the Fig. 14 caption needs more,
including references for the 100, 95 and 90 geotherms) -->
