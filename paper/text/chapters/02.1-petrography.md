## Petrography

Polished thin sections of 250 µm thickness were
prepared for six peridotite xenolith samples
(CK-2 through CK-7) and the basaltic host lava (CK-1). The
xenolith samples were bound with epoxy prior to sectioning.
Large-format rectangular thin sections were prepared for two lava samples dominated
by dunite cumulate fragments (CK-D1 and CK-D2).
The samples were evaluated under a petrographic microscope to determine
their textural and mineralogic variation. Characteristic textures of the
xenolith samples and basaltic host are shown in @fig:microscope-images.

### Host lava

The host lava (CK-1) is an alkali basalt with sparse vesicles and abundant
phenocrysts of feldspar, clinopyroxene, and olivine.
The samples also contain dunite and multiphase peridotite fragments
ranging from aggregates of a few grains to ~5 cm diameter.

The groundmass is dominated by altered glass and microcrystalline
plagioclase lathes.
Though dominantly black, it is mottled with slightly greenish grey color domains
at ~500 mm scale, which likely correspond to different levels of alteration.
These domains are cross-cut by elongate narrow (~1 mm) flow shear bands of
finer-grained material with sparse vesicles and phenocrysts.

Petrographic study of cumulate fragments within the Crystal Knob
basalt reveals residues from multiple stages of melt fractionation.
Samples CK-D1 and CK-D2 are dominated
by dunite and peridotite fragments up to 2 cm in diameter. The
peridotite fragments show textures similar to those in samples CK-2 to CK-7.
The dunites fragments are cumulate textured and finer-grained than the peridotites,
with characteristic grain sizes ranging from 50--200 µm for different fragments.
Intergranular melt inclusions <!-- now altered to ??? -->
are evident between olivine grains.
In some samples, dunite encases peridotite fragments containing large (up to
2 mm) grains of olivine, pyroxene, and spinel. CK-D1 notably contains a large spinel grain with a
pitted rim embedded in dunite.
The dunite cumulates in these samples are texturally representative of
the vast majority of xenoliths Crystal Knob basalt.

deep magma chambers with entrainment of the wall rock

Taken together, these samples appear to
represent interactions with the melt throughout their history -->

The peridotite samples (CK-2 through CK-7) were texturally classified using
the scheme of @Pike1977. All samples display an allotriomorphic granular
texture with anisotropy largely absent. There are
no significant petrographically observed plastic deformation features
(e.g. kink domains in olivine grains) in any of the samples. However,
samples CK-2 and CK-5 exhibit a weak shape-preferred alignment in elongate
spinels.

Minor late-stage alteration products are seen in all peridotite samples.
This includes variably Fe-rich grain boundaries of major phases and Ti
enrichment in pyroxene rims (<10 µm from the grain
edge). Sample CK-4 contains an alteration channel that cuts linearly
across the thin section. This channel is bounded by resorbed boundaries
of the major phases (olivine and orthopyroxene) and hosts
microcrystalline clinopyroxene, 10 µm-scale euhedral spinels,
and minor amphibole. Near this melt channel, thin streamers of
intergranular fill show compositions enriched in Na and Ti. These
fills are present (but less extensive) in sample CK-3, and
generally absent in other samples. Samples other than CK-3 and CK-4
largely do not show melt infiltration along grain boundaries, instead
having major phases in contact (though many grain boundaries are fractured).
Clinopyroxene grains in all samples, but most notably CK-3 and CK-4,
are strongly intergrown with orthopyroxene.
Sample CK-7 shows abundant exsolution lamellae and graphic recrystallization of
orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene.
