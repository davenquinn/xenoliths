## Petrographic and analytical methods {#sec:methods}

Polished thin sections of 30 µm thickness were
prepared for six peridotite xenolith samples
(CK-2 through CK-7) and the basalt host lava (CK-1). The
xenolith samples were bound with epoxy prior to sectioning. 1$\times$2 inch
rectangular thin sections were prepared for two dunite cumulate samples hosted
in basalt (CK-D1 and CK-D2). The samples were evaluated under a petrographic
microscope to determine their textural and mineralogic features. Characteristic
textures of the xenolith samples and basaltic host are shown in
@fig:microscope-images, and their textural characteristics are summarized in
@tbl:sample_petrography.

Electron backscatter intensity
images of each thin section were collected using a ZEISS 1550 VP field
emission SEM at the California Institute of Technology. These were coregistered
with optical scans and electron-microprobe analysis points using an affine
transformation between fixed stage coordinates. Modal mineralogy was mapped on
a grid atop these aligned datasets [@fig:textures].

Major-element compositions were measured on polished thin sections with
a five-spectrometer JEOL JXA-8200 electron-probe microanalyzer at the
California Institute of Technology. Abundances were counted in
wavelength-dispersive mode using a 15 kV accelerating potential, a focused 25
nA beam, and counting times of 20 seconds on-peak and 10 seconds off-peak. The
instrument was calibrated using natural and synthetic standards; matrix
corrections were made using the CITZAF [@Armstrong1988] algorithm. We performed
1714 measurements across the six peridotite samples, concentrated in 3-4
locations of interest per sample emphasizing areas with orthopyroxene
and clinopyroxene in contact to aid in thermometry. We also took 403
measurements of the basaltic host and entrained dunites [@tbl:composition].

Minerals were automatically assigned for microprobe measurements using
a nearest-neighbor fitting algorithm between pure endmember phases. These
analyses were aligned with optical and backscatter imagery and
checked for consistency: poor-quality measurements with low totals were
automatically flagged for removal [@Taylor1998], and mixed phases along grain
boundaries were discarded on a case-by-case basis.

Additional isotope and trace-element geochemical techniques applied to the
harzburgite and lherzolite samples are discussed throughout @sec:xenoliths.

## The basaltic host

The Crystal Knob host rock (sample CK-1) is an alkali basalt with sparse
vesicles and abundant plagioclase feldspar, potassium feldspar, clinopyroxene, and olivine
phenocrysts. The sample also contains dunite and multiphase peridotite
fragments ranging from aggregates of a few grains to ~5 cm xenoliths.

The groundmass is dominated by altered glass and abundant
microphenocrysts of potassium and plagioclase feldspar.
Though dominantly black, it is mottled with greenish-grey alteration color
domains at ~500 µm scale. These domains are cross-cut by elongate narrow (~1 mm) shear
bands of finer-grained material with sparse vesicles and phenocrysts.

Petrographic study of dunite fragments within the Crystal Knob basalt reveals
residues from multiple stages of melt fractionation. Thin sections CK-D1 and
CK-D2 contain dunite and peridotite fragments up to 2 cm in diameter within
a basaltic groundmass. The peridotite fragments show textures similar to the
polyphase peridotite samples (CK-2 to CK-7). The dunite fragments have
textures typical of cumulate residues: finer-grained than the peridotites,
they contain similar-sized (typically 50--200 µm), closely-packed olivine
grains with melt filling intergrain spaces. Some dunite encases peridotite
fragments containing large (up to 2 mm) grains of olivine, pyroxene, and
spinel. CK-D1 notably contains a large, pitted, spinel grain embedded in
dunite. These dunite cumulates are texturally representative of the
majority of xenoliths in the Crystal Knob basalt.

Clinopyroxene in the lava groundmass is separated into two compositional
groups: some phenocrysts show an average Mg# of ~76 (Mg# defined as molar
Mg/(Mg+Fe) $\cdot$ 100). A separate group of high-Mg# clinopyroxenes (up to
Mg# 91) are hosted in xenolith fragments and cores of zoned single grains.
Concentrically-zoned clinopyroxene grains with high-Mg# cores up to 300 µm
in diameter [@fig:cpx_profile] record multistage crystallization in
a progressively evolving magma, and thin, low-Mg# rims suggest that the
last phase of fractionation likely occurred during magma ascent and
cooling.

<!--[[[fig:cpx_profile]]]-->

Olivine grains in the host lava sample a range from fertile
major-element compositions (Mg# $\approx$ 89) through progressively lower
Mg#, with cumulate aggregates clustered at Mg#=68 [@fig:major_elements|a].
We suspect the olivine grains in the basalt represent both fragments of
the mantle source (xenocrysts, possibly mechanically separated from
entrained peridotites) and cumulates that crystallized at various stages
of melt evolution.

## Eruptive age

The age of lavas hosting mantle xenolith suites is required to link their
petrogenesis to tectonic and geodynamic processes [e.g. @Ducea1998b]. The age
of the Crystal Knob host lava was determined using the
\ce{$^{40}$Ar}/\ce{$^{39}$Ar} technique on phenocryst plagioclase. A billet of
the host lava (sample CK-1) containing visible plagioclase lathes was provided
to the USGS Geochronology Laboratory in Denver, Colorado. The sample was
irradiated in the USGS TRIGA reactor, and plagioclase feldspar grains were
step-heated *in situ* using an infrared laser. Loss of
\ce{$^{39}$Ar} was measured simultaneously on a Thermo Scientific Argus VI
using 4 Faraday detectors (m/e 40-37) and ion counting (m/e 36). The detectors
were intercalibrated using standard gas and air pipettes. The measurements are
corrected for blanks above baselines, radioactive decay, and nucleogenic
interferences, and standardized against a Fish Canyon sanidine with an age of
28.20 Ma. Non-radiogenic argon is assumed to have an atmospheric composition of
\ce{$^{40}$Ar}/\ce{$^{39}$Ar} = 298.56 [@Cosca2011].

<!--[[[tbl:step_heating_table]]]-->


Step-heating data are presented in @tbl:step_heating_table and shown
graphically in @fig:step_heating. Our preferred age of 1.65$\pm$0.06 Ma
($2\sigma$) is defined by the twelve intermediate of fifteen heating steps. The
entire spectrum defines a similar age, within error, of 1.71 Ma. We infer that
the xenoliths were entrained from the upper mantle directly beneath the
Crystal Knob volcanic pipe during the mid-Pleistocene.
