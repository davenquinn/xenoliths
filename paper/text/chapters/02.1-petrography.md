## Petrographic and analytical methods {#sec:methods}

Polished thin sections of 250 µm thickness were
prepared for six peridotite xenolith samples
(CK-2 through CK-7) and the basaltic host lava (CK-1). The
xenolith samples were bound with epoxy prior to sectioning.
Large-format rectangular thin sections were prepared for two lava samples dominated
by dunite cumulate fragments (CK-D1 and CK-D2).
The samples were evaluated under a petrographic microscope to determine
their textural and mineralogic variation. Characteristic textures of the
xenolith samples and basaltic host are shown in @fig:microscope-images.

Major-element compositions were
analyzed for each polished thin section on a five-spectrometer JEOL JXA-8200
electron-probe microanalyzer at the California Institute of Technology.
Abundances were counted in wavelength-dispersive mode using a probe
current of 15 kV. The instrument was calibrated using natural and
synthetic standards; matrix corrections were made using the CITZAF
[@Armstrong1988] algorithm. 1714 measurements were performed across the
six peridotite samples, concentrated in 3-4 locations of interest per
sample. Areas with orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in contact were emphasized to
aid in thermometry. 403 measurements of basaltic host and entrained dunites were also taken.

Electron backscatter intensity
images of each thin section were collected using a ZEISS 1550 VP field
emission SEM at the California Institute of Technology. These were
coregistered with optical scans and electron-microprobe analyses.
Minerals were automatically classified from microprobe data
using a nearest-neighbor fitting algorithm between pure endmember
phases. Poor-quality measurements with low totals were automatically
flagged using a scheme based on that of @Taylor1998, and mixed phases
along grain boundaries were discarded on a case-by-case basis.
The resulting classification was checked for consistency with optical
and backscatter imagery.

Isotope and trace-element geochemical techniques are used only
for the harzburgite and lherzolite samples in the dataset, and are
discussed throughout @sec:xenoliths.

## The basaltic host

The Crystal Knob lava (sample CK-1) is an alkali basalt with sparse vesicles and abundant
phenocrysts of feldspar, clinopyroxene, and olivine.
The sample also contains dunite and multiphase peridotite fragments
ranging from aggregates of a few grains to ~5 cm diameter.

The groundmass is dominated by altered glass and microcrystalline
plagioclase lathes.
Though dominantly black, it is mottled with slightly greenish grey color domains
at ~500 µm scale, which likely correspond to different levels of alteration.
These domains are cross-cut by elongate narrow (~1 mm) flow shear bands of
finer-grained material with sparse vesicles and phenocrysts.

Petrographic study of cumulate fragments within the Crystal Knob
basalt reveals residues from multiple stages of melt fractionation.
Samples CK-D1 and CK-D2 (dunite-containing thin sections from CK-1) are dominated
by dunite and peridotite fragments up to 2 cm in diameter. The
peridotite fragments show textures similar to those in samples CK-2 to CK-7.
The dunites fragments are cumulate textured and finer-grained than the peridotites,
with characteristic grain sizes ranging from 50--200 µm for different fragments.
Intergranular melt pockets
are evident between olivine grains.
In some samples, dunite encases peridotite fragments containing large (up to
2 mm) grains of olivine, pyroxene, and spinel.
CK-D1 notably contains a large spinel grain with a
pitted rim embedded in dunite.
The dunite cumulates in these samples are texturally representative of
the vast majority of xenoliths Crystal Knob basalt.

The Crystal Knob basalt contains abundant phenocrysts of olivine and clinopyroxene,
and microphenocrysts of potassium and plagioclase feldspar.
A large population of clinopyroxene phenocrysts show an average Mg# of ~76.
A separate population of high-Mg# measurements (up to Mg# 91) are hosted
in xenolith fragments and relict cores of single grains.
Zoned clinopyroxene grains show a stepwise crystallization
history in a progressively evolving magma. The grain highlighted in
[@fig:cpx_profile] has a large core with Mg# ~90, but material with Mg# < 75
occurs only in the outermost 30 µm of the grain. This suggests that the
last phase of the magma's fractionation occurred relatively quickly,
perhaps as the flow cooled.

Major-element analysis of olivine "phenocrysts" in the
host lava shows a well-sampled trendline from compositions comparable to fertile
peridotite xenoliths (Mg# $\approx$ 89) through
progressively lower Mg# cumulate grains,
with cumulate aggregates clustered at Mg#=68 [@fig:major_elements].
Thus, olivine grains in the host lava range from true phenocrysts,
to cumulates from various intermediate stages of magma evolution
and entrained xenocrysts corresponding to entrained peridotites.

Petrographic features and the presence of phenocrysts recording multiple stages
of magmatic enrichment suggest that the Crystal
Knob material experienced a multiphase history of fractional crystallization.
The Crystal Knob basalt contains fragments (both single-crystal
and lithic aggregates) entrained from the lithospheric mantle and dunite cumulates.
The phenocrysts record a compositional progression that indicates precipitation during
multiple stages of fractionation.
