## Petrographic and analytical methods {#sec:methods}

Polished thin sections of 250 µm thickness were
prepared for six peridotite xenolith samples
(CK-2 through CK-7) and the basalt host lava (CK-1). The
xenolith samples were bound with epoxy prior to sectioning.
Large-format rectangular thin sections were prepared
for two host basalt samples dominated
by dunite cumulate fragments (CK-D1 and CK-D2).
The samples were evaluated under a petrographic microscope to determine
their textural and mineralogic features. Characteristic textures of the
xenolith samples and basaltic host are shown in @fig:microscope-images.

Major-element compositions were
analyzed for each polished thin section on a five-spectrometer JEOL JXA-8200
electron-probe microanalyzer at the California Institute of Technology.
Abundances were counted in wavelength-dispersive mode using a 15 kV
accelerating potential, a focused 25 nA beam, and counting times of 20
seconds on-peak and 10 seconds off-peak. The instrument was calibrated using natural and
synthetic standards; matrix corrections were made using the CITZAF
[@Armstrong1988] algorithm. 1714 measurements were performed across the
six peridotite samples, concentrated in 3-4 locations of interest per
sample. Areas with orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in contact were emphasized to
aid in thermometry. 403 measurements of basaltic host and entrained dunites were also taken.

Electron backscatter intensity
images of each thin section were collected using a ZEISS 1550 VP field
emission SEM at the California Institute of Technology. These were
coregistered with optical scans and electron-microprobe analyses.
Minerals were automatically classified from microprobe data
using a nearest-neighbor fitting algorithm between pure endmember
phases. Poor-quality measurements with low totals were automatically
flagged using a scheme based on that of @Taylor1998, and mixed phases
along grain boundaries were discarded on a case-by-case basis.
The resulting classification was checked for consistency with optical
and backscatter imagery.

Isotope and trace-element geochemical techniques were applied
for the harzburgite and lherzolite samples in the dataset, and are
discussed throughout @sec:xenoliths.

## The basaltic host

The Crystal Knob host rock (sample CK-1) is an alkali basalt
with sparse vesicles and abundant feldspar, clinopyroxene, and olivine phenocrysts.
The sample also contains dunite and multiphase peridotite fragments
ranging within the section from aggregates of a few grains to ~5 cm
xenoliths.

The groundmass is dominated by altered glass and microcrystalline
plagioclase lathes.
Though dominantly black, it is mottled with slightly greenish grey color domains
at ~500 µm scale, which likely correspond to different levels of alteration.
These domains are cross-cut by elongate narrow (~1 mm) flow shear bands of
finer-grained material with sparse vesicles and phenocrysts.

Petrographic study of cumulate fragments within the Crystal Knob
basalt reveals residues from multiple stages of melt fractionation.
Samples CK-D1 and CK-D2 (dunite-containing thin sections from CK-1) are dominated
by dunite and peridotite fragments up to 2 cm in diameter. The
peridotite fragments show textures similar to those in samples CK-2 to CK-7.
The dunites fragments are cumulate textured and finer-grained than the peridotites,
with characteristic grain sizes ranging from 50--200 µm between fragments.
Intergranular melt pockets are evident between olivine grains.
In some samples, dunite encases peridotite fragments containing large (up to
2 mm) grains of olivine, pyroxene, and spinel.
CK-D1 notably contains a large spinel grain with a
pitted rim embedded in dunite.
The dunite cumulates in these samples are texturally representative of
the vast majority of xenoliths in the Crystal Knob basalt.

The basalt groundmass contains abundant phenocrysts of olivine and clinopyroxene,
and microphenocrysts of potassium and plagioclase feldspar.
A large population of clinopyroxene phenocrysts show an average Mg# of ~76
(Mg# defined as molar Mg/(Mg+Fe) $\cdot$ 100).
A separate population of high-Mg# measurements (up to Mg# 91) are hosted
in xenolith fragments and relict cores of single grains.
Zoned clinopyroxene grains show a stepwise crystallization
history in a progressively evolving magma. The grain highlighted in
@fig:cpx_profile has a large core (likely an overgrown xenocryst)
with Mg# ~90, but material with Mg# < 75
occurs only in the outermost 30 µm of the grain. This suggests that the
last phase of the magma's fractionation occurred relatively, likely
during its ascent and cooling.

Olivine grains in the host lava show a well-sampled trend from fertile
major-element compositions (Mg# $\approx$ 89) through progressively lower Mg#,
with cumulate aggregates clustered at Mg#=68 [@fig:major_elements|a]. Thus,
olivine grains in the host lava range from xenocrysts (possibly mechanically
separated from entrained peridotites) to phenocrysts, with cumulates from
intermediate stages of magma evolution in between.

## Eruptive age

The age of lavas hosting mantle xenolith suites is required to link their
petrogenesis to tectonic and geodynamic processes [e.g. @Ducea1998b]. The age
of the Crystal Knob host lava was determined using the
\ce{$^{40}$Ar}/\ce{$^{39}$Ar} technique on phenocryst plagioclase. A billet of
the host lava (sample CK-1) containing visible plagioclase lathes was provided
to the USGS Geochronology Laboratory in Denver, Colorado. The sample was
irradiated in the USGS TRIGA reactor, and plagioclase feldspar grains were
step-heated *in situ* using an infrared laser [@fig:step_heating].
\ce{$^{39}$Ar} loss was measured simultaneously on a Thermo Scientific Argus VI
using 4 Faraday detectors (m/e 40-37) and ion counting (m/e 36). The detectors
were intercalibrated using standard gas and air pipettes. The measurements are
corrected for blanks above baselines, radioactive decay, and nucleogenic
interferences, and standardized against a Fish Canyon sanidine with an age of
28.20 Ma. Non-radiogenic argon is assumed to have an atmospheric composition of
\ce{$^{40}$Ar}/\ce{$^{39}$Ar} = 298.56 [@Cosca2011].

Step-heating data are presented in @tbl:step_heating_table and shown
graphically in @fig:step_heating. Our preferred age of 1.65±0.06 Ma (2\sigma)
is defined by the twelve intermediate of fifteen heating steps. The entire
spectrum defines a similar age, within error, of 1.71 Ma. From these ages we
infer that the xenoliths were entrained from the upper mantle directly
underlying the Crystal Knob volcanic pipe during the mid-Pleistocene.
