## Contemporary lithospheric structure and thermal state

In this section we integrate the results of our thermal modeling with
our petrogenetic findings on the Crystal Knob xenoliths, regional
crustal structure and evolution, and the timing and map position of
xenolith entrainment. Of the three plausible scenarios depicted for the
evolution of the sub-Crystal Knob mantle lithosphere on Figure 16 we
reject the shallow slab window emplaced asthenosphere case based on our
thermal modeling presented above. The Monterey plate stalled slab and
underplated Farallon plate mantle nappe cases are equally plausible
based on our thermal modeling. Based on a wide spectrum of geologic and
geodynamic factors, that were discussed above, we dismiss the notion of
a regionally extensive Monterey Plate “dangling slab” extending far to
the east of the San Andreas fault as suggested by @Pikser2012.
Depending on the original scale of Monterey Plate underthrusting beneath
the southern California borderland region (Fig. 18), its structural
integrity following its coupling to borderland transrotational rifting,
and on what proportion of the partially subducted plate is now
represented by the detached portion that forms the Transverse Ranges
high-wave speed anomaly \figref{context}, an argument could be made that an
underthrust portion of the Monterey Plate has been translated northwards
horizontally beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site
(Figure \ref{neogene_sections}b). Although
kinematically plausible, in theory, this case seems unlikely based on
dynamic factors. As with the “dangling slab” version of this case,
horizontal translation of such a large mantle mass along the base of the
crust should manifest at surface levels by transients in dynamic
topography, as well brittle crustal deformational responses to
horizontal shear stresses in the lower crust. Such surface deformation
patterns are not expressed for late Cenozoic time north of the
Transverse Ranges though. Furthermore, such horizontal translation of a
previously underthrust slab offers little in terms of melting mechanisms
neither for Neogene nor Pleistocene volcanic centers of the region. We
thus conclude that despite of our findings on the Crystal Knob xenolith
suite not being able to discriminate between the stalled Monterey plate,
or underplated Farallon nappe cases, the stalled Monterey plate case
creates more problems than it solves.

On Figure 16c we show the partially subducted terminus of the Monterey
plate bounded to the east by the San Gregorio-Hosgri fault, based on our
above discussion of the Figure 18 reconstruction. East of the fault lies
the Nacimiento Franciscan complex and its tectonic veneer of Salinia
nappes (not differentiated on the figure), and its lower crustal oceanic
crustal duplex tectonically above underplated Farallon plate mantle
nappes. The structural profile shown on Figure 16c between the San
Andreas and San Gregorio-Hosgri faults was constructed at southern
California latitudes in continuity with that of the southernmost Sierra
Nevada and adjacent Mojave plateau region (Figs. 17 and 18). Partial
subduction, or stalling, of the Monterey plate occurred along the outer
edge of Franciscan complex further south than rocks of the Nacimiento
belt (Fig. 18).

Slab window opening beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site is
reconstructed to have occurred between ca. 28-23 Ma [@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005].
As posited above, the thick and relatively
cool lithospheric lid that the slab window of this region opened beneath
inhibited widespread voluminous volcanism in response to asthenospheric
upwelling. The time lag between deep slab window opening and the ca. 1.7
Ma eruption age of Crystal Knob presents a problem for the origin of the
Crystal Knob lava. Our studies on the Crystal Knob xenoliths indicate an
underlying lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at a depth of 50-80 km,
which is consistent with regional seismic studies placing it at ~70 km
beneath the central California Coast Ranges [@Li2007]. In
contrast 28-20 Ma old oceanic lithosphere of the adjacent Monterey plate
[@Wilson2005], based on thermal decay relations [@Doin1996],
would have its lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at ~35 km.
The offshore Monterey plate is at the edge of \citet[]['s]{Li2007}
resolution, which yields an ~50 km depth for the
lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.  Proximal to the modern shoreline
the Monterey plate is thrust beneath ~12 km of sedimentary accretionary
prism [@Trehu1991], bringing the thermal maturation theoretical depth
for the transition much closer to the depth observed by @Li2007.
Crystal Knob is located ~15 km east of the Hosgri fault, with it’s host
Franciscan complex pervasively cut by faults and shear zones
[@Cowan1978; @Seiders1989]. The geologic slip and seismicity history of the
Hosgri fault [@Dickinson2005; @Hardebeck2012] indicate that it
was likely active during the eruption of the Crystal Knob neck.
Integration of theoretical and observational data on intra-continental
transform faults [@Platt2011; @Titus2007] indicate
that at lower crustal--upper mantle levels Hosgri fault shear could be
distributed across 10s of kilometers normal to the fault surface [Figure \ref{neogene_sections}].
Eruption of small-volume basaltic flows of Plio-Pleistocene age,
some with lower crust and upper mantle xenoliths also occurred ~150 km
north of Crystal Knob along the San Andreas-Calaveras fault bifurcation
zone [@Jove1998; @Titus2007]. Xenoliths recovered
from these flows record asthenosphere ascent and partial melting that
markedly post-dates any possible slab window opening, and thus the
Crystal Knob small volume eruption is not an exceptional event.

Distributed shearing and strike-slip juxtaposition of the shallow
sub-Monterey plate asthenosphere against underplated Farallon plate
lithosphere and its deep slab window asthenosphere along the Hosgri
fault (Fig. 16c) is a plausible mechanism for Crystal Knob basalt melt
generation. This was perhaps accentuated by possible extensional
transients along the fault surface as documented for the Coyote Lake
basalts [@Jove1998; @Titus2007]. Thermal modeling
presented above indicates that underplated Farallon mantle was already
re-heated by the deeper Neogene slab window. The dominance of dunite
cumulate xenoliths that appear to be related to the Crystal Knob lava,
and that volumetrically far exceed the lithospheric peridotite
xenoliths, attest to at least another reheating event at ca. 1.7 Ma. Two
of the principal thermal maxima in the Coast Range thermal anomaly occur
in the areas of the Crystal Knob and Coyote Lake Plio-Pleistocene
basaltic eruptions [@Erkan2008, Fig. 1], further
suggesting recent mobilization of asthenospheric mantle that was
initially emplaced into the early Neogene slab window. 


Conclusion
==========

- Slab window is really hot!
- Farallon plate and older forearc are really cold
    - Converging on “steady-state” value
- Farallon heated from below seems to work well
    - Provides a thermal buffer for low-heatflow coast range and can
      potentially help explain the Coast Range Thermal Anomaly

Thermal relaxation of a young stalled slab is largely similar to
a deep slab window, thermally buffered by old lithosphere.

An initial petrologic study of the Crystal Knob peridotite xenoliths has
been conducted, and thermobarometry has been applied to examine the
thermal state of their mantle source. These xenoliths sample the
lithosphere at moderate to deep (45-80 km) depths and are divided into
two groups which record subtly different temperatures. Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr
isotopes show that the samples are derived from the depleted convecting
mantle. <!-- Given the location of the Salinian block adjacent to the Mojave
prior to \SI{5}{Ma},--> Given this, the samples are derived from
some generation of the Farallon downgoing slab. However, the thermal models
approach equilibrium at long timescales, and depth constraints are
imperfect at best, so distinguishing between the plateau-emplacement and
older underplating scenarios is difficult at best. No compelling features
to distinguish these two scenarios are as yet identifiable.

Continuing refinement of thermometry and depth constraints
along with forward-modeling of temperature scenarios will potentially
improve the ability to resolve the structure of the geotherm, but the
uncertainties inherent in spinel peridotite barometry may prove
crippling. Regardless, the completed work and continuing petrologic
analysis of the host basalt and cumulates will lead to an improved
understanding of the coastal California mantle lithosphere.
