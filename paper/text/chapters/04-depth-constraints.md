## Depth constraints

<!--[[depth]]-->

The depth of the xenolith samples in the mantle lithosphere, when
combined with temperature, provides a fully-defined constraint on the
geotherm beneath Crystal Knob at the time of eruption. For spinel
peridotites, equilibration depths can only be analytically
determined within broad boundaries.
However, we present several lines of reasoning suggesting that the
xenoliths were sourced from relatively deep in the spinel stability
field.

Peridotite barometers are based on the decreasing Al content of
orthopyroxene with depth [@Nickel1985; @Brey1990; @Nimis2000]. However, in
the absence of garnet, the reaction is purely thermometric, with nearly
vertical isopleths in P-T space [@Herzberg1978; @Gasparik2000]. With no
reliable geobarometers for spinel peridotites, several less robust
measures are used to evaluate the depth of the xenolith source.

### Limits of spinel stability

Minimum entrainment depths of all peridotite xenoliths
must be greater than ~30 km, the depth of both the
Moho near the eruption site [@Trehu1991]
and the plagioclase--spinel peridotite facies transition
[@Green1970a]. The xenolith entrainment depth must exceed the boundary of spinel stability,
which is composition-dependent and poorly constrained for natural systems,
but thought to lie over the 50-80 km depth interval
[@ONeill1981; @Kinzler1997; @Gasparik2000; @Klemme2004].

<!-- This paragraph needs more -->
The high Cr# of the hotter samples corresponds to an expanded stability field of
spinel against garnet to deeper depths. Several studies have attempted to estimate
the magnitude of this effect [@Klemme2000; @Klemme2004; @ONeill1981].
`Figure depth` shows this depth increases estimated by the simple empirical
relationship given in @ONeill1981, showing that potential depths increase by up to
10 km.<!-- This paragraph is confusing. It needs more explanation, and closer
ties to what is shown on Figure 14. Also the Fig. 14 caption needs more,
including references for the 100, 95 and 90 geotherms) -->

### Ca-in-olivine barometer

Equilibration pressure measurements are attempted for the peridotite
xenoliths using the @Kohler1990 Ca-in-olivine
barometer. This barometer is explicitly calibrated for spinel
peridotites but widely disregarded based on poor resolution,
vulnerability to late-stage diffusion, and dependence on Ca
concentrations in olivine near analytical thresholds for
electron microprobe analysis [@Medaris1999; @OReilly1997].
The imprecision of the method is modeled by separately calculating
pressure for each nearest-neighbor pair of measurements,
propagating analytical errors through the calculation.
Temperature and pressure are jointly solved to incorporate the
pressure-dependence of the BKN thermometer.
A Monte Carlo normal distribution is applied to the analytical
errors on each barometer estimate to show the distribution
of possible sample conditions in pressure--temperature space.
To convert between depth and pressure, we assume a constant geobaric
gradient of 30 km/GPa.

The Ca-in-olivine method yields a broad distribution in model depths,
largely coincident with the spinel stability field `[Figure depth]`.
The low-temperature samples in particular have significant scatter
towards depths below the spinel-in isograd.
The depth distributions are largely normal, with modes
ranging from 35 to 52 km.
The low and high-temperature cohorts remain separable, with high-temperature
samples generally showing deeper equilibrium depths.

### Discussion

Estimates of the thermal state of the deep lithosphere derived from seismic
tomography show temperatures of 700--1100ÂºC occurring at depths of
50--100 km for coastal California [@Goes2002].
