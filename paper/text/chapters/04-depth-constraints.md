## Depth constraints

<!--[[depth]]-->

The depth of the xenolith samples in the mantle lithosphere, coupled
with equilibration temperatures, provides a fully-defined constraint on the
geotherm beneath Crystal Knob at the time of eruption. For spinel
peridotites, equilibration depths can only be analytically
determined within broad boundaries. With no reliable geobarometers for spinel peridotites, several less robust measures are used to evaluate the depth of the xenolith source. We present several lines of reasoning suggesting that the
xenoliths were sourced from relatively deep within the spinel stability
field.

### Limits of spinel stability

Minimum entrainment depths of all peridotite xenoliths must be greater than ~30 km, the depth of both the Moho near the eruption site [@Trehu1991] and the plagioclase--spinel peridotite facies transition [@Green1970a], and less than the high-pressure boundary of spinel stability.

This phase transition is composition-dependent and poorly constrained for
natural systems, but thought to lie over the 50-80 km depth interval
[@ONeill1981; @Kinzler1997; @Gasparik2000; @Klemme2004]. As shown in `Figure
cr-number`, samples in the high-temperature cohort (CK-3, CK-4, and CK-6) have
higher spinel Cr# than the low-temperature samples. This enrichment in
refractory Cr corresponds to an expanded stability field of spinel
against garnet to deeper depths. Several experimental studies have attempted to
estimate the magnitude of this effect.
For generic mantle compositions without Cr, the maximum depth of the spinel
stability field ranges is roughly 18-20 GPa (55-60 km) at 1000-1200ºC
[@Klemme2004], which is slightly higher than that envisioned by @ONeill1981 and
others. Experimental results and
thermodynamic modeling [@ONeill1981; @Klemme2000; @Klemme2004]
suggest that chromian spinels can have much higher
pressures of stability. The thermodynamic models suggest a broad garnet-spinel
costability field (up to a spinel-out reaction at 5 GPa for Cr# of ~30), but
the relative metastability of these phases is unconstrained and ideal
garnet--spinel mixing is assumed [@Klemme2004].
In practice, few natural samples contain these phases together [!! citation needed !!], so it is entirely possible that samples are sourced from the upper
parts of this shared field. Because of this ambiguity, we prefer the simple empirical relationship given in @ONeill1981, which corresponds to a rough estimate for the garnet-in pressure for a level of spinel composition.
`Figure depth` shows this depth increases
estimated by this empirical relationship (with error bars of 0.15 GPa). Though not rigorous, this simple treatment shows that the maximum possible entrainment depths of the high temperature samples increase by up to 15 km, from ~65 km for the low-temperature samples, to maximum depths of ~80 km for the high-temperature cohort.

It needs more explanation, and closer ties to what is shown on Figure 14. Also
the Fig. 14 caption needs more, including references for the 100, 95 and 90
geotherms) -->

### Ca-in-olivine barometer

Peridotite barometers are based on the decreasing Al content of
orthopyroxene with depth [@Nickel1985; @Brey1990; @Nimis2000]. However, in
the absence of garnet, the reaction is purely thermometric, with nearly
vertical isopleths in P-T space [@Herzberg1978; @Gasparik2000].

Equilibration pressure measurements are attempted for the peridotite
xenoliths using the @Kohler1990 Ca-in-olivine
barometer. This barometer is explicitly calibrated for spinel
peridotites but should be treated with caution based on poor resolution,
vulnerability to late-stage diffusion, and dependence on low Ca
concentrations in olivine near analytical thresholds for
electron microprobe analysis [@Medaris1999; @OReilly1997].

To model the variability of model pressures due to analytical uncertainties,
barometry is applied separately for nearest-neighbor pyroxene and olivine measurements.
Analytical errors are propagated through the calculation.
To correct for the mild pressure dependence of the two-pyroxene thermometer, and the
temperature dependence of the olivine barometer, we jointly solve temperature and
pressure by optimizing to a common solution for each analysis.
In `Figure depth`, we apply a Monte Carlo normal distribution to the analytical
errors on each pressure estimate to show the distribution
of possible sample conditions in pressure--temperature space.
To map pressures to depths, we use the simplistic assumption of a constant geobaric
gradient of 30 km/GPa.

The Ca-in-olivine method yields a broad distribution in model depths,
largely coincident with the spinel stability field `[Figure depth]`.
The low-temperature samples in particular have significant scatter
towards depths below the spinel-in isograd.
The depth distributions are largely normal, with modes
ranging from 35 to 52 km.
The low and high-temperature cohorts remain separable, with high-temperature
samples generally showing deeper equilibrium depths.

### Discussion

Estimates of the thermal state of the deep lithosphere derived from seismic
tomography show temperatures of 700--1100ºC occurring at depths of
50--100 km for coastal California [@Goes2002].
