## Depth constraints

<!--[[depth]]-->

Pyroxene-exchange geothermometry shows that the peridotite samples form
two groups in temperature with centroids separated by roughly 60ºC.
These temperatures seem to correspond to the samples being sourced along
a depth gradient.
The depth of the xenolith samples in the mantle lithosphere, coupled
with equilibration temperatures, provides a fully-defined constraint on the
geotherm beneath Crystal Knob at the time of eruption. For spinel
peridotites, equilibration depths can only be analytically
determined within broad boundaries. With no reliable geobarometers for spinel peridotites,
several less robust measures are used to evaluate the depth
of the xenolith source. We present several lines of reasoning suggesting that the
xenoliths were sourced along a depth gradient relatively deep within the spinel stability
field, between roughly 45 and 80 km.

### Limits of spinel stability

Minimum entrainment depths of all peridotite xenoliths must be greater than ~30 km,
the depth of the Moho near the Crystal Knob eruption site [@Trehu1991],
which will be discussed in more detail in @sec:regional_structure.
Another minimum depth constraint is the plagioclase--spinel peridotite
facies transition, which occurs at depths of  [@Green1970a], and less than the high-pressure boundary of spinel stability.

The spinel--garnet peridotite phase transition is
composition-dependent and poorly constrained for
natural systems, but thought to lie over the 50-80 km depth interval
[@ONeill1981; @Kinzler1997; @Gasparik2000; @Klemme2004].
The breakdown depth of spinel is strongly dependent on temperature and composition, particularly
the amount of refractory Cr hosted by spinel.
Several experimental and thermodynamic studies have attempted to
estimate the magnitude of this effect.
@ONeill1981 presented experiments both with and without Cr and described
a simple empirical relationship of spinel-out depth with Cr content and temperature.
@Robinson1998 suggests that, given fertile "Pyrolite" compositions with little
Cr,  garnet is unstable at depths less than 80 km at the peridotite solidus (~1470ºC at this depth).
Subsolidus experimental results show that the maximum depth of the spinel
stability field in the absence of Cr ranges from 1.8-2.0 GPa (55-60 km) at 1000-1200ºC
[@Klemme2000], a slightly deeper estimate than @ONeill1981.
Chromian spinels can be stable to much greater depth:
thermodynamic modeling by @Klemme2004 suggests a broad garnet-spinel
co-stability field (up to a spinel-out reaction at 5 GPa for Cr# of ~30),
but given the unconstrained assumption of ideal
garnet--spinel mixing, a spinel-weighted metastable assemblage is possible even
at higher pressures.

As shown in @fig:cr-number, samples in the high-temperature cohort (CK-3, CK-4, and CK-6) have
higher spinel Cr# than the low-temperature samples. This enrichment in
refractory Cr arises from the increased depletion of these samples and
expands the stability field of spinel against garnet to deeper depths.

Though @Robinson1998, @Klemme2000, and @Klemme2004 show a higher-pressure and
more complex phase transition than originally understood, these differences are focused at high
temperatures and pressures.
The rough estimate of the garnet-in pressure
given by @ONeill1981 is sufficiently accurate at T < 1200 ºC and is used to graphically illustrate
the high-pressure constraint on the Crystal Knob xenoliths. @fig:depth
shows the phase-transition depths estimated by this empirical relationship,
given the Cr# of each sample (with error bars of 0.15 GPa). This simple treatment shows that the
maximum possible entrainment depths of the high-Cr samples increase by
up to 15 km relative to Cr-free compositions, from ~65 km for the
low-temperature samples to maximum depths of ~80 km for the high-temperature cohort.

### Ca-in-olivine barometer

Peridotite barometers are based on the decreasing Al content of
orthopyroxene with depth [@Nickel1985; @Brey1990; @Nimis2000]. However, in
the absence of garnet, the reaction is purely thermometric, with nearly
vertical isopleths in P-T space [@Herzberg1978; @Gasparik2000].

Equilibration pressure measurements are attempted for the peridotite
xenoliths using the @Kohler1990 Ca-in-olivine
barometer. This barometer is explicitly calibrated for spinel
peridotites but should be treated with caution based on poor resolution,
vulnerability to late-stage diffusion, and dependence on low Ca
concentrations in olivine near analytical thresholds for
electron microprobe analysis [@Medaris1999; @OReilly1997].

To model the variability of model pressures due to analytical uncertainties,
barometry is applied separately for nearest-neighbor pyroxene and olivine measurements.
Analytical errors are propagated through the calculation.
To correct for the mild pressure dependence of the two-pyroxene thermometer, and the
temperature dependence of the olivine barometer, we jointly solve temperature and
pressure by iteratively optimizing to a common solution for each set of
microprobe measurments.
This yields a set of independent, internally consistent depth and temperature
measurements for each sample corresponding to individual pairs of
microprobe measurements.
In [@fig:depth], we show the full pressure--temperature error space for each
sample by applying a Monte Carlo random sampling to the analytical
errors on each pressure estimate.
To map pressures to depths, we assume a constant geobaric
gradient of 30 km/GPa.

The Ca-in-olivine barometer yields a broad distribution in model depths,
largely coincident with the spinel stability field [@fig:depth].
The low-temperature samples in particular have significant scatter
towards depths below the spinel-in isograd.
The depth distributions are largely normal, with modes
ranging from 35 to 52 km.
The low and high-temperature cohorts remain separable, with high-temperature
samples generally showing deeper equilibrium depths.

### Discussion

For reasonable slopes of the sub-Salinian geotherm,
this range of temperatures may sample a depth range of 5-15 km within
the mantle lithosphere. These depths must be greater than 30 km, the
depth to the Moho, <!-- appropriate reference --> and less than
60-90 km based on the composition-dependent lower limit of the spinel stability field.
<!-- Say how trace element and REE temperatures relate to this -->

Estimates of the thermal state of the deep lithosphere derived from seismic
tomography show temperatures of 700--1100ºC occurring at depths of
50--100 km for coastal California [@Goes2002].
