# Origin of the mantle lithosphere beneath Crystal Knob {#sec:tectonic_scenarios}

The Crystal Knob spinel peridotite xenoliths are uniformly isotopically
depleted, with an $\epsilon_\mathrm{Nd}$ of 10.3-11.0, and
\ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .7023-.7024. These values are typical for the
depleted upper mantle [e.g. @Hofmann1997] and require a mantle source that
has not been recycled from the western North American subcontinental mantle or
continental lithosphere more generally. The Crystal Knob xenolith suite is the
only known direct sampling of this underplated mantle.

The lack of radiogenically enriched arc residues in the Crystal Knob xenolith
suite  confirms the unrooted nature of Salinia continental arc rocks [e.g.
@Hall2013] that lie slivered above the Franciscan accretionary complex that
dominates the regional crustal column. This suggests the existence of a major
structural discontinuity below the crust of the Coast Ranges, with underplated,
slightly depleted peridotite forming the framework of the mantle lithosphere.
Several tectonic events experienced by the Coast Ranges since the Cretaceous
provide a means to append suboceanic mantle lithosphere or upwelling
asthenosphere to the base of the crust.

The Franciscan complex of the region was assembled by sustained subduction of
the Farallon plate during the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic [@Cowan1978;
@Saleeby1986; @Seton2012; @Chapman2016a]. The mantle lithosphere beneath the
eastern Mojave Plateau was constructed from partly subducted Farallon-plate
upper mantle late in this Franciscan accretionary history [@Luffi2009], and an
outboard equivalent of this mechanism could have built the mantle lithosphere
beneath Crystal Knob.

In the Oligocene to early Miocene, the Pacific-Farallon spreading ridge
obliquely intersected the Cordillera subduction zone at the coast of southern
California, leading to the development of the San Andreas transform system
[@Atwater1970]. Ridge impingement was kinematically complex due to large-offset
ridge-ridge transforms, resulting in the opening of a geometrically complex
slab window and the production of the Monterey microplate
[@fig:reconstruction], which nucleated as an oblique intra-oceanic rift along
an ~250 km long segment of the Pacific-Farallon ridge [@Thorkelson1989;
@Bohannon1995; @Atwater1998; @Wilson2005]. Late Cenozoic volcanism of the
coastal region of central California has been attributed to partial melting of
asthenosphere as it ascended into the slab window [@Wilson2005].

<!--[[[fig:reconstruction]]]-->

Alternatively, it has been suggested that microplate formation along the
impinging Pacific-Farallon ridge was more dominant than slab window
upwelling, and that these microplates stalled beneath coastal central
California as the Farallon plate continued to subduct deeper into the
mantle [@Bohannon1995; @Brocher1999; @VanWijk2001]. In this scenario,
late Cenozoic volcanism in the region is linked to the youthfulness of the
subducted microplate(s), implying a partial melting mechanism within and
directly below the lithospheric lid. Both the slab window (or gap) and stalled
microplate hypotheses are based on plate kinematic relationships which require
a combination of slab window and stalled oceanic microplate segments
[@Bohannon1995; @Atwater1998; @tenBrink1999; @Wilson2005].

The cross-sections presented in @fig:neogene_sections show the first-order
crustal relations implied by three potential origins for the sub-Crystal Knob
mantle lithosphere: **A**. shallowly ascended asthenosphere within the
Pacific-Farallon slab window [@Atwater1998]; **B**. subduction of an
underplated, or stalled, Monterey oceanic microplate [@Bohannon1995]; or **C**.
underplated Farallon plate mantle lithosphere nappe(s) that lie in structural
sequence with the upper mantle duplex resolved beneath the Dish Hill xenolith
location in the Mojave region [@Luffi2009]. Scenarios **A** and **B** have been
proposed in previous models of the lithospheric structure of the California
coast [@Erkan2008], while scenario **C** is constructed from a large body of
literature on crustal and mantle-lithosphere tectonics since the Cretaceous.

## The Neogene slab window {#sec:slab_window}

@fig:reconstruction shows the hypothetical surface projection of the
Pacific-Farallon slab window
and partially subducted Monterey plate at ca. 19 Ma [@Wilson2005].
The slab window formed by subduction of the trailing edge
of the Farallon plate, unsupported by sea floor
spreading along the former spreading axis with the Pacific plate.
According to the @Wilson2005 reconstruction of the
Pacific-Farallon slab window and adjacent Monterey plate [@fig:reconstruction],
the Crystal Knob eruption site was located above a slab window in the early
Neogene, ~50-100 km northeast of the northeastern boundary transform of the
Monterey plate. Diffuse volcanism, some clearly derived from
decompression partial melting of convecting mantle, is widespread at
this time period across the region of the reconstructed slab window
[@Hurst1982; @Sharma1991; @Cole1995; @Wilson2005].
However, this phase of slab window opening and related volcanism
cannot account for the eruption of the ca. 1.7 Ma Crystal Knob volcanic
neck itself, which we return to in @sec:crystal_knob_eruption.

## The Monterey plate stalled slab

When the East Pacific Rise first reached the North American plate at
28.5 Ma, the Monterey microplate broke from the Farallon slab and
subducted independently until 19.5 Ma, while rotating clockwise with respect to
the Pacific plate [@Wilson2005]. @fig:reconstruction shows the incipient tear
between the rotating Monterey microplate and the bulk of the downgoing Farallon
slab. The remnant microplate has been integrated into the Pacific plate and
still forms part of the abyssal seafloor in the proximal offshore region
[@fig:context].

The eastward extent of the partially subducted Monterey Plate slab is unknown,
and there is some evidence that it is truncated by the San Gregorio-Hosgri
fault system [see @sec:stalled-slab-bad]. However, the Monterey plate may have
separated at a deeper level and translated northward beneath a reactivated
subduction megathrust [@fig:neogene_sections|b]. A recent permutation of the
stalled slab hypothesis is that the Monterey plate extends eastward of the
San Andreas fault as a horizontally translated stalled slab, potentially
reaching ~300 km depth beneath the eastern Central Valley [@tenBrink1999;
@Pikser2012; @Wang2013].

If the downdip portion of the stalled slab extended east of the
San Gregorio-Hosgri fault, it would make up the mantle lithosphere beneath
Crystal Knob. Although geodynamically suspect, this model has been presented as
a candidate for construction of the mantle lithosphere in previous modeling of
the thermal structure of the Coast Ranges [@Erkan2008] and is commonly invoked
in the seismology literature [e.g. @Wang2013]. We include the model in our
consideration of thermal history, but return to its viability in
@sec:stalled-slab-bad.

## Underplated Farallon Plate mantle nappes  {#sec:farallon_nappe}

The reconstruction of the Crystal Knob eruption site to its pre-San Andreas
position [@fig:reconstruction] places it outboard of the Mojave province, where
much of the mantle lithosphere was replaced by Farallon-plate nappes during the
Cretaceous. An outboard extension of this underplating, prior to Neogene
transform faulting, is a highly viable alternative for the development of the
site’s underlying mantle lithosphere.

The pre-Neogene tectonic setting of the Crystal Knob eruption site is shown in
@fig:reconstruction by restoration of the San Andreas dextral transform system
[@Matthews1976; @Dickinson2005; @Chapman2012; @Hall2013; @Sharman2013]. The
Crystal Knob eruption site restores to a position outboard of the southern
California batholith. The principal windows into shallowly underplated
subduction channel schists are shown in @fig:reconstruction along with the
principal upper plate batholithic exposures. The current western extent of the
Salinia crystalline nappes is shown as the Nacimiento fault and the offshore
Farallon escarpment. Crystalline rocks of the Salinia nappes extended an
unknown distance westwards across the Nacimiento belt Franciscan [@Hall2013],
but were eroded off the lower plate complex as the coastal region rose in the
Pliocene [@Ducea2003b].

The Crystal Knob neck erupted through the
Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan complex, immediately adjacent to the
current western limit of Salinia crystalline nappes [@fig:context].  Accretion
of the Nacimiento belt occurred in the Late Cretaceous beneath the outer
reaches of the Salinia nappe sequence [@Hall2013; @Chapman2016a].
In their core area, the Salinia nappes rode westwards on slightly
older, higher metamorphic grade, Franciscan rocks that are
shown in @fig:context and @fig:reconstruction as windows into subduction channel schists
[@Barth2003; @Kidder2006; @Ducea2009]. The southernmost Sierra Nevada-western Mojave
"autochthon" for the Salinia nappes is likewise detached from its
original mantle wedge underpinnings, and shingled into crystalline
nappes that lie on underplated high-grade subduction channel schists
[@Saleeby2003; @Chapman2010; @Chapman2012; @Chapman2016b]. Tectonic
erosion of the mantle wedge followed by shallow subduction underplating
of Franciscan rocks requires subsequent reconstruction of the current
mantle lithosphere. @Luffi2009 and @Armytage2015 present
petrologic studies on the Dish Hill and Cima mantle xenolith suites [@fig:context] that
suggest the presence of a mantle lithosphere duplex with multiple
Farallon plate upper mantle nappes in structural sequence beneath an
eastern residual roof of continental mantle lithosphere. Since the crustal
structural sequence of the western Mojave region is closely
spatially and temporally correlated to
that of the Salinia nappes [@Chapman2010; @Chapman2012; @Chapman2016],
it stands to reason that upper mantle duplex accretion progressed
westwards from the Mojave region to beneath the Salinia
nappes as well as the Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan.

### Mantle underplating after flat subduction

In @fig:cross_sections, we present a model for the tectonic
underplating of the Farallon plate mantle lithosphere beneath
the Mojave-Salinia-Nacimiento segment of
the Late Cretaceous convergent margin [after @Saleeby2003; @Luffi2009]. This
occurred in conjunction with shallow flat subduction of the Shatsky Rise
conjugate Large Igneous Province [@Saleeby2003; @Liu2010; @Sun2017]. The
approximate age of Farallon plate entering the trench is shown on each frame
[after @Seton2012]. Crustal deformation, timing, and thermal conditions are
integrated from @Kidder2006, @Chapman2010, @Chapman2012, and @Chapman2016a.
@fig:cross_sections|a and b show the arrival of the oceanic plateau into the
subducting trench, and plateau buoyancy-driven shallowing of the subduction
megathrust, which drove tectonic erosion of the mantle wedge. Temperature
conditions along the flat subduction megathrust initiated at \~900 ºC, ambient
conditions within the deep levels of the then-active arc, and cooled to ~715
ºC, peak temperatures recorded in shallowly subducted metaclastic rocks of the
Sierra de Salinas schist, exposed in the principal Salinia window into the
subduction channel schists [@Kidder2006].

<!--[[[fig:cross_sections]]]-->

In @fig:cross_sections|c and d we adopt the focused slab rollback and mantle
lithosphere underplating models of @Saleeby2003 and @Luffi2009, for the dynamic
response of the forearc to the end of LIP subduction. Gravitational collapse
and/or suction by the retreating slab drove crustal responses including
large-magnitude, trench-directed extension coupled to regional extrusion of the
underplated subduction channel schists. In the @fig:cross_sections|c to
d transition, accelerated rollback corresponds to the formation of
Farallon-plate mantle duplexes. Buoyancy-driven resistance to LIP subduction
could have driven the transient imbrication of Farallon plate mantle
lithosphere and establishment of successive basal megathrust surfaces (leading
to forearc overthickening, as mentioned above). Alternatively, duplex formation
could have occurred due to negative buoyancy during retreating subduction, with
tensile stresses in the slab promoting nappe detachment. Observational data and
laboratory experiments show that profound co-seismic dilation transients can
develop along subduction megathrusts [@Gabuchian2017], underscoring the
potential ability of tensile stresses to cause dislocations in subducting
slabs. We suspect that mantle nappe detachment was mediated by the temperature
of the brittle-plastic transition in olivine. For ~40-50 Myr old oceanic
lithosphere entering the subduction zone [@fig:cross_sections|c and d], this
~700-800 ºC transition [@Warren2006; @Burgmann2008; @Mei2010] occurs at ~25-40
km depth in the slab [@Doin1996].

The lack of high-pressure mafic schists in both the Crystal Knob and Dish
Hill xenolith suites further suggests that slivers of oceanic crust were detached
along with mantle lithosphere nappes (presumably from oceanic Moho depths) to be
underplated as the seismically imaged thickened mafic lower crust of the
region [@Trehu1991; @Brocher1999].
On the basis of both the regional structural evolution
of the central to southern California basement and
the petrogenetic history recorded in the region's mantle xenolith suites, we
suspect the @fig:cross_sections|d section most accurately represents the
construction of the mantle domain sampled by Crystal Knob. This section is
idealized for Late Cretaceous time, and we now layer the complexity of late
Cenozoic tectonics onto this framework.

### A deep slab window beneath relict lithosphere

Kinematic reconstructions of the
impingement of the Pacific-Farallon
spreading center on the SW Cordilleran subduction zone require a
slab window beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site in the early Neogene
[@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005]. Previous modeling of thermal effects of the slab
window [@Erkan2008] only investigated the resulting emplacement of
asthenosphere at immediate subcrustal levels. However, the depth of
asthenospheric underplating related to slab window opening is poorly
constrained and likely varies geographically as a function of thickness and
thermal variations in the pre-existing lithospheric lid, as well its state of
stress and structural coherency. Though volcanism in the central California
Coast Ranges has been tied to slab window opening [e.g @Ernst1974], it has been
volumetrically insignificant when compared to that generated by other coeval
examples of shallow asthenospheric upwelling in the Cordillera such as the
high-flux volcanism generated in the Basin and Range province in the
Eocene--Miocene [e.g. @Humphreys1995].

The lack of a signature of shallow asthenospheric mantle in the
Miocene is readily explained if the slab window opened beneath
pre-existing mantle lithosphere originating in the Cretaceous. This would
consist of a tiered duplex of underplated Farallon-plate oceanic crust and
mantle lithosphere nappes, roofed by the Nacimiento Franciscan and Salinia
nappes. Our estimate of a 45-75 km depth interval over which the Crystal Knob
lavas sampled the underlying mantle lithosphere [@fig:depth], coupled with
a general lack of significant late Cenozoic extensional faulting in the
immediate region, implies a strong thermo-mechanical lid that likely suppressed
the ascent of voluminous asthenosphere derived magmas that were hypothetically
sourced from a deep underlying slab window.
