## Trace Elements

Trace element concentrations were acquired for pyroxene grains
in each xenolith sample,
using a Cameca IMS-7f-GEO magnetic-sector secondary ion mass
spectrometer (SIMS) at the California Institute of Technology. Two to
three each of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene grains were targeted per
xenolith sample. Measurements were acquired with 9 kV beam flux and a
100 µm spot size. The USGS glass standard NIST 610 was used as an
external standard for all elements [@Gao2002].
Minimal variation in measured concentration was observed
at grain and sample scale, though clinopyroxene in CK-6 and
orthopyroxene in CK-7 show differences outside of analytical error in
Ba, La, and Ce (potentially attributable to concentrations near SIMS
detection limits). Other measurements are largely concordant and results are
presented as within-sample averages in @tbl:trace_elements_table and
@fig:trace_elements. Whole-rock trace element abundances
\[@tbl:trace_elements_table and @fig:ree_model|a\] are estimated by scaling
measured concentrations in clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene to mineral modes.
Olivine is excluded from calculations, which is of minimal impact as rare-earth
elements (REEs) are 2-3 orders of magnitude less compatible in olivine than in
clinopyroxene [@WittEickschen2005;@Luffi2009]. The resulting whole-rock trace
element compositions correct for decreasing modal pyroxene abundances during
depletion.

Clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and recalculated whole-rock rare-earth elements
show the effects of both depletion and refertilization. The samples show
a range of depletion in rare-earth elements relative to depleted mantle, and
clinopyroxene HREEs (heavy REEs) follow patterns seen in abyssal peridotites
[@Warren2016] and consistent with single-stage depletion. Elevated LREEs (light
REEs) suggest later refertilization. Whole-rock trace elements also record this
pattern, but the incorporation of modal abundances highlights the range in REE
depletion: sample CK-5 in particular has much lower REE concentrations than its
clinopyroxene abundances would suggest, due to low clinopyroxene modes.

### Modeling depletion and re-enrichment {#sec:depletion-model}

The partial correspondence of the trace-element dataset to abyssal peridotites
suggests that enrichment can be compared to a typical mantle
fractional melting history. We construct a melt-partitioning model to determine
the degree of depletion of the Crystal Knob xenolith samples and distinguish
between potential enriching agents [@fig:ree_model|a].

A generic model of peridotite depletion is constructed in *alphaMELTS*
[@Smith2005b], using the pMELTS family of algorithms. A parcel of material is
tracked along an isentropic fractional melting path (1% melt porosity) starting
at a mantle potential temperature of 1350ºC, 3.0 GPa, and a depleted MORB
mantle (DMM) composition [@Workman2005]. Trace-element partition
coefficients from @Lee2007 are used to track these components, and we confirm
that garnet is removed from the evolving system at ~2.0 GPa. These starting
parameters were chosen to provide the best correspondence with the overall
experimental dataset. A wide range of initial conditions (up to 1500ºC at 3.0
GPa) provides similar results for the shape of depleted trace-element profiles,
and the mapping of predicted composition to temperature depends on starting
conditions.

The samples are fit to model steps along this adiabatic
path using minimization of the squared deviations of measured values from model
HREE (Er--Lu) compositions. HREE concentrations can reasonably be assumed to be
a proxy for depletion, since HREEs are highly compatible, have low diffusion
rates, and are not easily modified by late re-enrichment. Thus, the
best-fitting decompression step gives a model composition for the samples after
single-stage depletion. The measured composition of sample CK-2 matches this
modeled composition across the REEs, while other samples have much higher LREE
concentrations than is reasonable for residues of decompression melting.

In a second arithmetic step, the best-fit depleted profile is subtracted from
measured REE. Excess REE in the sample (typically LREE) is interpreted as the
contribution from batch addition of an enriching melt. To improve comparability
of the trace-element pattern with that of potential enriching agents, the model
is normalized to an average HREE of 6$\times$primitive mantle, a typical HREE
concentration for both normal MORB [@Sun1989] and alkali basalt [@Farmer1995].
The slope of the resulting normalized profile is diagnostic of the relative
abundance of trace elements in the re-enriching agent. The normalization factor
employed to shift the composition of enriching fluids to this value
[@fig:ree_model|b] is proportional to the amount of material added during
re-enrichment (assuming a consistent composition).

<!--[[[fig:ree_model]]]-->

The model results show that partial melting, followed by re-enrichment by
alkali basalt, can explain the trace-element variability within the Crystal
Knob sample set. REEs in the fertile lherzolite CK-2 follow the modeled trend
for nearly undepleted peridotite [@fig:ree_model]. Enrichment by the
assimilation of small amounts (<1%) of a melt with a trace-element pattern
similar to alkali basalt is reasonable for all samples [@fig:ree_model|b]. The
low pyroxene modes in samples CK-3 and CK-4 lead to pronounced
LREE enrichment, with the assimilation of small masses of enriching melt
greatly increasing normalized abundances. However, if HREEs have been
substantially enriched (as may be the case for sample CK-6), excess LREE is
a minimum constraint on re-enrichment.

<!--[[[tbl:depletion_degrees]]]-->

Primary depletion degrees are estimated by finding
the pMELTS model compositions that best fit the whole-rock HREE, MgO, and
\ce{Al2O3} composition of each xenolith sample [@tbl:depletion_degrees].
Results show trends superficially similar to those in modal abundance
[@fig:modes] and trace element [@fig:trace_elements] data.

### Discussion of trace elements

The HREE compositions and modeled depleted REE profiles of the Crystal
Knob xenoliths are similar to those found in abyssal
peridotites [@Johnson1990],
suggesting that the xenoliths are residues of progressive fractional melting
of primitive mantle at the mid-ocean ridge.
Trace element patterns, and their alignment with
phase composition and modal abundance, suggest that HREE depletion within
the Crystal Knob samples is primary, without significant HREE re-enrichment.
These trends are a proxy for fertility, and the lherzolite CK-2 is essentially
undepleted and apparently has not been fractionally melted.

The variably elevated LREE content of all samples except CK-2 is not present in
abyssal peridotites [@fig:trace_elements] and suggests secondary re-enrichment
by LREE-rich material at depth. Our modeling of whole-rock depletion and
re-enrichment suggests a similar degree of LREE refertilization for all samples
except CK-2, corresponding to a volumetrically minor <1% bulk assimilation of
fractionated basaltic melt. The most pronounced LREE enrichments occur in
infrequent clinopyroxene grains in depleted harzburgites (CK-3 and CK-4), and
may arise from the preferential assimilation of REEs in sparse clinopyroxene.
Sample CK-6 contains high LREEs in excess of those formed at any stage of
fractional melting. This suggests that CK-6 assimilated a significant amount of
more-evolved melt and has a trace-element profile (including HREE composition)
formed by refertilization.
