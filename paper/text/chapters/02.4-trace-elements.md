## Trace Elements

Trace element concentrations were acquired for pyroxene grains
in each xenolith sample,
using a Cameca IMS-7f-GEO magnetic-sector secondary ion mass
spectrometer (SIMS) at the California Institute of Technology. Two to
three each of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene grains were targeted per
xenolith sample. Measurements were acquired with 9 kV beam flux and a
100 µm spot size. The USGS glass standard NIST 610 was used as an
external standard for all elements [@Gao2002].
Minimal variation in measured concentration was observed
at grain and sample scale, though clinopyroxene in CK-6 and
orthopyroxene in CK-7 show differences outside of analytical error in
Ba, La, and Ce (potentially attributable to concentrations near SIMS
detection limits). Other measurements are largely concordant and results are
presented as within-sample averages in @tbl:trace_elements_table and
@fig:trace_elements. Whole-rock trace element abundances
[@tbl:trace_elements_table and @fig:ree_model|a] are estimated by scaling
measured concentrations in clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene to mineral modes.
Olivine is excluded from calculations, which is of minimal impact as rare-earth
elements (REEs) are 2-3 orders of magnitude less compatible in olivine than in
clinopyroxene [@WittEickschen2005;@Luffi2009]. The resulting whole-rock trace
element compositions correct for decreasing modal pyroxene abundances during
depletion.

Clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and recalculated whole-rock rare-earth elements
show the effects of both depletion and refertilization. The samples show
a range of depletion in rare-earth elements relative to depleted mantle, and
clinopyroxene HREEs (heavy REEs) follow patterns seen in abyssal peridotites
[@Warren2016] and consistent with single-stage depletion. Elevated LREEs (light
REEs) suggest later refertilization. Whole-rock trace elements also record this
pattern, but the incorporation of modal abundances highlights the range in REE
depletion: sample CK-5 in particular has much lower REE concentrations than its
clinopyroxene abundances would suggest, due to low clinopyroxene modes.

### Modeling depletion and re-enrichment {#sec:depletion-model}

The partial correspondence of the trace-element dataset to abyssal peridotites
suggests that enrichment can be quantified in reference to a typical mantle
fractional melting history. We construct a melt-partitioning model to determine
the degree of depletion of the Crystal Knob xenolith samples and distinguish
between potential enriching agents [@fig:ree_model|a].

A generic model of peridotite depletion is constructed in *alphaMELTS*
[@Smith2005b], in which a parcel of material starting at a mantle potential
temperature of 1350ºC at 3.0 GPa and a depleted MORB mantle (DMM) composition
[@Workman2005] is tracked along an isentropic fractional melting path with
a melt porosity of 1%, using the pMELTS family of algorithms. Trace-element
partitioning coefficients from @Lee2007 are used to track these components, and
we confirm that garnet is removed from the evolving system at ~2.0 GPa. These
starting parameters were chosen to provide the best correspondence with the
overall experimental dataset. A wide range of initial conditions (up to 1500ºC
at 3.0 GPa) provide similar results for the shape of depleted trace-element
profiles, and the mapping of predicted composition to temperature depends on
starting conditions.

The samples are fit to model steps along this adiabatic
path using minimization of the squared deviations of measured values from model
HREE (Er--Lu) compositions. HREE concentrations can reasonably be assumed to be
a proxy for depletion, since HREEs are highly compatible, have low diffusion
rates, and are not easily modified by late re-enrichment. Thus, the
best-fitting decompression step gives a model composition for the samples after
single-stage depletion. The measured composition of sample CK-2 matches this
modeled composition across the REEs, while other samples have much higher LREE
concentrations than is reasonable for residues of decompression melting.

A second arithmetic step is applied to find the trace-element pattern of
a potential enriching agent: the best-fit depleted profile is subtracted from
the sample composition, and excess measured LREE is interpreted as the
contribution from batch addition of an enriching melt. To compare against
various potential enriching agents, the model is normalized to an average
HREE of 6$\times$primitive mantle, a typical HREE concentration for both normal
MORB [@Sun1989] and alkali basalt [@Farmer1995]. The slope of the resulting
normalized profile is diagnostic of the relative abundance of trace elements in
the re-enriching agent. The normalization factor employed to shift the
composition of enriching fluids to this value [@fig:ree_model|b] is
proportional to the amount of material added during re-enrichment (assuming
a consistent composition).

The model results confirm the that the Crystal Knob samples were variably
depleted and re-enriched, while the fertile lherzolite CK-2 follows the modeled
trend of nearly undepleted peridotite [@fig:ree_model]. Enrichment by the
assimilation of small amounts (<1%) of a melt with a trace-element pattern
similar to alkali basalt is reasonable for all samples [@fig:ree_model|b]. The
lack of REE and low pyroxene modes in samples CK-3 and CK-4 leads to pronounced
LREE enrichment, with the assimilation of small masses of enriching melt
greatly increasing normalized abundances. However, if HREEs have been
substantially enriched (as may be the case for sample CK-6), excess LREE is
a minimum constraint on re-enrichment.

Primary depletion degrees are estimated by finding
the pMELTS model compositions that best fit the whole-rock HREE, MgO, and
\ce{Al2O3} composition of each xenolith sample [@tbl:depletion_degrees].
Results show trends superficially similar to those in modal abundance
[@fig:modes] and trace element [@fig:trace_elements] data.

### Discussion of trace elements

The HREE compositions and model-recovered depleted REE profiles of the Crystal
Knob xenoliths suggest that they are residues of progressive fractional melting
of primitive mantle at the mid-ocean ridge, similar to those found in abyssal
peridotites [@Johnson1990]. Trace element patterns, and their alignment trends
in phase composition and modal abundance, suggest that HREE depletion within
the Crystal Knob samples is primary, without significant HREE re-enrichment.
These trends are a proxy for fertility, and the lherzolite CK-2 is essentially
undepleted and apparently has not been fractionally melted.

The variably elevated LREE content of all samples except CK-2 is not present in
abyssal peridotites [@fig:trace_elements] and suggests secondary re-enrichment
by LREE-rich material at depth. The most pronounced LREE enrichments occur in
depleted harzburgites with the lowest clinopyroxene modes (CK-3 and CK-4).
These enrichments may arise from the preferential assimilation of rare-earths
in sparse clinopyroxene. Accordingly, our modeling of whole-rock depletion and
re-enrichment suggests a similar degree of LREE refertilization for all samples
except CK-2, corresponding to a volumetrically minor <1% bulk assimilation of
fractionated basaltic melt.

Sample CK-6 contains high LREEs in excess of those formed at any stage of
fractional melting. This suggests that CK-6 assimilated a significant amount of
more-evolved melt and has a trace-element profile (including HREE composition)
formed by refertilization.
