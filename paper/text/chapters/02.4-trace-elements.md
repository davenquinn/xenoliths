## Trace Elements

<!-- ## Methods  -->
Trace element concentrations were acquired for pyroxene grains
in each xenolith sample,
using a Cameca IMS-7f-GEO magnetic-sector secondary ion mass
spectrometer (SIMS) at the California Institute of Technology. Two to
three each of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene grains were targeted per
xenolith sample. Measurements were acquired with 9 kV beam flux and a
100 µm spot size. The USGS glass standard NIST 610 was used as an
external standard for all elements [@Gao2002]<!-- this ref is for
LA-ICP-MS -->. Minimal variation in measured concentration was observed
at grain and sample scale, though clinopyroxene in CK-6 and
orthopyroxene in CK-7 show differences outside of analytical error in
Ba, La, and Ce (potentially attributable to concentrations near SIMS
detection limits). Other measurements are largely concordant and results
are presented as within-sample averages. Whole-rock trace element
abundances are estimated using measured concentrations in clinopyroxene
and orthopyroxene and mineral modes. Olivine is excluded from
calculations, which is of minimal impact as
rare-earth elements (REEs) are 2-3 orders of magnitude less
compatible than in clinopyroxene [@WittEickschen2005;@Luffi2009].
Results for measured pyroxene and recalculated whole-rock trace elements
are shown in @tbl:trace_elements. Graphical results for pyroxene REEs
are shown in @fig:spider, and estimated whole-rock modes are shown in
@fig:ree_model.

Clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and recalculated whole-rock rare-earth elements show several modes of
variation between samples, corresponding to different amounts of
depletion and re-enrichment.
All samples show clear evidence of rare-earth element
depletion, although the amount of this depletion varies.
For clinopyroxenes, the samples show progressive depletion in rare-earth
elements following patterns seen in abyssal peridotites
[@fig:cpx_literature_comparison].

### Modeling depletion and re-enrichment

Clinopyroxene REE patterns tell only part of the story of whole-rock
depletion and re-enrichment.
Combining pyroxene trace-element measurements with modal mineralogy
suggests that pyroxene modes have changed significantly in response to
depletion, making recalculated whole-rock trace elements a valuable tool
to assess the overall level of depletion in the sample.
Sample CK-5 in particular is much more depleted in whole-rock
composition than its clinopyroxene trace-element composition would suggest, due to
low clinopyroxene modes.

A depletion model is constructed
in *alphaMELTS* [@Smith2005b] to illuminate the probable depletion and
re-enrichment paths of the Crystal Knob sample [@fig:depletion_model].
A generic model of peridotite depletion is constructed, in which
a parcel of material starting at a mantle
potential temperature of 1300ºC at 2.0 GPa
and a depleted MORB mantle composition [@Workman2005] is
tracked along an isentropic fractional melting path with a melt porosity of 1%.
These starting parameters were chosen to provide the best correspondence
with the overall experimental dataset, but a wide range of initial
starting parameters (up to 1500ºC at 3.0 GPa) provide similar results.

The Crystal Knob xenolith samples are fit
to model steps along this adiabatic path using minimization of the
squared deviations of measured values from model HREE (Er--Lu) compositions.
Since HREEs are not likely to be
easily modified by late re-enrichment due to their low diffusion rates,
the best-fitting model step is used as an estimate of single-stage
depletion of the samples during decompression melting.

The difference between the sample composition and this fitted depleted
profile is taken as the contribution from batch addition of an
enriching fluid. The net amounts of REE added during re-enrichment are
then normalized to an average of 12$\times$primitive mantle for HREE, reflecting
the average HREE concentrations in likely enriching fluids including
normal MORB [@Sun1989] and alkali basalt [@Farmer1995]. The slope of
the resulting normalized profile is diagnostic of the trace-element
profile of the re-enriching agent.
The normalization factor employed to shift the composition of enriching
fluids to this value is shown in Figure \ref{fig:depletion_model}b and corresponds
roughly to the amount of LREE added during re-enrichment.

The results of this model show that
the samples are variably depleted and all except CK-2 are re-enriched to
some extent [@fig:ree_model]. CK-2 appears to be in equilibrium with mid-ocean ridge
basalt while the others appear to be in equilibrium with an enriching
agent similar to alkali basalt. The strong exponential increase in the
presumed LREE composition of our enriching material shows that the
re-enrichment may be better modeled as a fractional process. It is
likely that all samples experienced a small and similar amount of interaction with
the enriching fluid [@fig:ree_trends].

Primary depletion degrees of the xenolith samples are estimated by finding
the model compositions that best fit the whole-rock HREE, MgO, and
\ce{Al2O3} composition of each sample. Results are summarized
in @tbl:depletion_degrees and show trends superficially similar to
those visible in modal abundance [@fig:modes] and trace element
[@fig:spider] data. The degree of depletion generally increases
with the modeled temperature of the sample, with the notable exception of
sample CK-6, which is by far the least-depleted sample by major-element
proxies and only moderately depleted in heavy rare-earth elements,
although it has the hottest modeled temperature.

### Discussion of trace elements

The trace element dataset developed here suggests that
the samples were variably depleted of REEs following
progressive fractional melting [@Johnson1990].
All of the samples underwent
wholesale REE depletion (due to higher-degree melting) followed by later
LREE re-enrichment. Our modeling suggests that the degree of
re-fertilization is similar for all samples, with less than
1% melt assimilation in all cases (assuming a somewhat enriched fluid
with HREE similar to MORB or alkali basalt). However, the more residual samples
with the lowest clinopyroxene modes show pronounced re-enrichment in
clinopyroxene REEs, which likely arises from rare-earth inputs being
primarily focused in clinopyroxene. Still the patterns of re-enrichment
found in these samples are not found in abyssal peridotites [@Warren2016],
suggesting that this pattern arose from secondary re-enrichment by
LREE-rich material at depth.

The overall pattern of trace elements suggests that the xenolith samples are residues of progressive
fractional melting of primitive mantle to form abyssal peridotites [@Johnson1990].
The samples underwent
a multistage history of wholesale REE depletion (due to higher-degree
melting) followed by later LREE re-enrichment by an enriched fluid.
This general pattern is similar
to that gained by emplacement at a mid-ocean ridge followed by
refertilization by off-axis magmatism [@Luffi2009]. However, it may also
have arisen during melt extraction and entrainment prior to eruption.
The latter seems to demand a significant residence time of the hotter
xenoliths in a magma chamber at depth to allow LREE refertilization.
