## Trace Elements

<!-- ## Methods  -->
Trace element concentrations were acquired for pyroxene grains
in each xenolith sample,
using a Cameca IMS-7f-GEO magnetic-sector secondary ion mass
spectrometer (SIMS) at the California Institute of Technology. Two to
three each of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene grains were targeted per
xenolith sample. Measurements were acquired with 9 kV beam flux and a
100 µm spot size. The USGS glass standard NIST 610 was used as an
external standard for all elements [@Gao2002]<!-- this ref is for
LA-ICP-MS -->. Minimal variation in measured concentration was observed
at grain and sample scale, though clinopyroxene in CK-6 and
orthopyroxene in CK-7 show differences outside of analytical error in
Ba, La, and Ce (potentially attributable to concentrations near SIMS
detection limits). Other measurements are largely concordant and results
are presented as within-sample averages. Whole-rock trace element
abundances are estimated using measured concentrations in clinopyroxene
and orthopyroxene and mineral modes. Olivine is excluded from
calculations, which is of minimal impact as
rare-earth elements (REEs) are 2-3 orders of magnitude less
compatible than in clinopyroxene [@WittEickschen2005;@Luffi2009].
Results for measured pyroxene and recalculated whole-rock trace elements
are shown in `Table trace_elements`.

<!--[[spider]]-->

Clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and recalculated whole-rock rare-earth element show several modes of
variation between samples, corresponding to different amounts of
depletion and re-enrichment.
All samples show clear evidence of rare-earth element
depletion, although the amount of this depletion varies.
The cooler samples show progressive depletion in light rare-earth
elements (LREEs) and undepleted heavy rare-earths (HREEs). The warmer
samples show progressive HREE depletion and enrichment in LREEs. These
trends are inverted, so CK-4, the most HREE-depleted sample, is also the
most LREE-enriched.

<!-- Maybe this paragraph should go lower? --> This pattern suggests
that the cooler samples were depleted of (relatively more incompatible)
LREEs as residues of progressive fractional melting [@Johnson1990].
The warmer group of samples underwent a multistage history of
wholesale REE depletion (due to higher-degree melting) followed by later
LREE re-enrichment. This overprinting relationship is similar to that
observed in mid-ocean ridge peridotites, with ridge crest depletion
followed by off axis refertilization via infiltration of low-melt
fraction magmas [@Luffi2009]. However, this relationship may also have
arisen during melt extraction and entrainment immediately prior to eruption. The latter
seems to demand a significant residence time of the hotter xenoliths in,
or proximal to, a magma chamber at depth to allow LREE
refertilization.

### Depletion

For clinopyroxenes, the low-temperature cohort ranges from essentially
undepleted (CK-7 has a flat chondrite-normalized REE profile) to low
levels of depletion characteristic of the least-depleted abyssal
peridotites `[Figure cpx_literature_comparison]`. The high-temperature
cohort seems to have been both depleted (based on low HREE
concentrations) and re-enriched in trace elements to a much greater
degree than the low-temperature samples.

<!-- (Daven, do you think that the high-T group attained its signature
at the Farallon-Pacific spreading ridge, or from re-heating of
underplated Farallon mantle by the slab window convection event?). -->


In whole-rock space, the relationship between sample temperature and level of
depletion is less clear.
Combining pyroxene trace-element measurements with modal mineralogy
suggests that pyroxene modes have changed significantly in response to
depletion, making recalculated whole-rock trace elements a valuable tool
to assess the overall level of depletion in the sample.
Sample CK-5 in particular is much more depleted in whole-rock
composition than its cpx trace-element composition would suggest, due to
low clinopyroxene modes.

### Modeling depletion and re-enrichment

A depletion model is constructed
in *alphaMELTS* [@Smith2005b] to illuminate the probable depletion and
re-enrichment paths of the Crystal Knob sample.
A generic model of peridotite depletion is constructed, in which
a parcel of material starting at a mantle
potential temperature of 1470ºC at 3.0 GPa
and a depleted MORB mantle composition [@Workman2005] is
tracked along an isentropic fractional melting path with a melt porosity of 1%.
These starting parameters were chosen to provide the best correspondence
with the overall experimental dataset.

The Crystal Knob xenolith samples are fit
to model steps along this adiabatic path using minimization of the
squared deviations of model HREE (Er--Lu) compositions.
Since HREEs are not likely to be
easily modified by late re-enrichment due to their low diffusion rates,
the best-fitting model step is used as an estimate of single-stage
depletion of the samples during decompression melting. 

The difference between the sample composition and this fitted depleted
profile is taken as the contribution from batch addition of an
enriching fluid. The REE concentrations of the enriching agent are then
normalized to an average of 12$\times$primitive mantle.
The normalization factor employed to shift the composition of enriching
fluids to this value is shown in `Figure ree_trends` and corresponds
roughly to the amount of LREE added during re-enrichment.

The results of this model show that
the samples are variably depleted and all except CK-2 are re-enriched to
some extent `[Figure ree_model]`. CK-2 appears to be in equilibrium with mid-ocean ridge
basalt while the others appear to be in equilibrium with an enriching
agent similar to alkali basalt. The strong exponential increase in the
presumed LREE composition of our enriching material shows that the
re-enrichment is likely better modeled as a fractional process. Variable
amounts of interaction with the enriched fluid are required to explain
the observed level of re-enrichment, with the most seen by samples CK-3
and CK-4 `[Figure ree_trends]`.

Primary depletion degrees of the xenolith samples are estimated by finding
the model compositions which best fit the whole-rock HREE, MgO, and
\ce{Al2O3} composition of each sample. Results are summarized
in `Table depletion_degrees` and are superficially similar to
the trends visible in modal abundance `[Figure modes]` and trace element
`[Figure spider]` data. The degree of depletion generally increases
with the modeled temperature of the sample, with the notable exception of
sample CK-6, which is by far the least-depleted sample by major-element
proxies and only moderately depleted in heavy rare-earth elements,
although it has the hottest modeled temperature.

Sample CK-6, although relatively fertile,
has much higher iron than the other samples. This makes
it seem likely that it was re-enriched from a more evolved source than
the baseline primitive mantle.

The overall pattern of trace elements suggests that the xenolith samples are residues of progressive
fractional melting of primitive mantle to form abyssal peridotites [@Johnson1990].
The samples underwent
a multistage history of wholesale REE depletion (due to higher-degree
melting) followed by later LREE re-enrichment by an enriched fluid.
This overprint is similar
to that gained by emplacement at a mid-ocean ridge followed by
refertilization by off-axis magmatism [@Luffi2009]. However, it may also
have arisen during melt extraction and entrainment prior to eruption.
The latter seems to demand a significant residence time of the hotter
xenoliths in a magma chamber at depth to allow LREE refertilization.
