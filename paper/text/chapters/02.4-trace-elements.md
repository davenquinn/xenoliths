## Trace Elements

Trace element concentrations were acquired for pyroxene grains
in each xenolith sample,
using a Cameca IMS-7f-GEO magnetic-sector secondary ion mass
spectrometer (SIMS) at the California Institute of Technology. Two to
three each of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene grains were targeted per
xenolith sample. Measurements were acquired with 9 kV beam flux and a
100 µm spot size. The USGS glass standard NIST 610 was used as an
external standard for all elements [@Gao2002].
Minimal variation in measured concentration was observed
at grain and sample scale, though clinopyroxene in CK-6 and
orthopyroxene in CK-7 show differences outside of analytical error in
Ba, La, and Ce (potentially attributable to concentrations near SIMS
detection limits). Other measurements are largely concordant and results are
presented as within-sample averages in @tbl:trace_elements_table and
@fig:trace_elements. Whole-rock trace element abundances are estimated by
scaling these measured concentrations in clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene to
mineral modes. Olivine is excluded from calculations, which is of minimal
impact as rare-earth elements (REEs) are 2-3 orders of magnitude less
compatible in olivine than in clinopyroxene [@WittEickschen2005;@Luffi2009].
The resulting whole-rock trace element compositions [@tbl:trace_elements_table
and @fig:ree_model|a] correct for decreasing modal pyroxene abundances during
depletion: sample CK-5 in particular has a much more depleted trace elements
composition than its clinopyroxene trace-element composition would suggest, due
to low clinopyroxene modes.

### Modeling depletion and re-enrichment {#sec:depletion-model}

We construct a melt-partitioning model to
determine the depletion and re-enrichment history of the Crystal Knob
sample set and distinguish between potential
enriching agents [@fig:ree_model|a].
A generic model of peridotite depletion is constructed
in *alphaMELTS* [@Smith2005b], in which
a parcel of material starting at a mantle
potential temperature of 1350ºC at 3.0 GPa
and a depleted MORB mantle composition [@Workman2005] is
tracked along an isentropic fractional melting path
with a melt porosity of 1%, using the pMELTS family of algorithms. Trace-element partitioning
coefficients from @Lee2007 are used to track these components,
and we confirm that garnet is removed from the evolving system at ~2.0 GPa.
These starting parameters were chosen to provide the best correspondence
with the overall experimental dataset. A wide range of initial
conditions (up to 1500ºC at 3.0 GPa) provide similar results
for the shape of depleted trace-element profiles, though these results
do not map to unique temperatures.

In the first model step, the Crystal Knob xenolith samples are fit
to model steps along this adiabatic path using minimization of the
squared deviations of measured values from model HREE (Er--Lu)
compositions. HREE concentrations can reasonably be assumed to be
a proxy for depletion, since HREEs are highly compatible and have
low diffusion rates, and are not easily modified by late re-enrichment.
Thus, the best-fitting decompression step gives an model composition
for the samples after single-stage depletion. The measured
composition of sample CK-2 matches this modeled composition
across the REEs, while other samples have much higher LREE
concentrations than is reasonable for residues of decompression melting.

For the depleted samples (all except CK-2), a second step is taken to
find the trace-element pattern of a potential enriching agent.
The fitted depleted profile is subtracted from the sample composition,
and excess measured LREE is interpreted
as the contribution from batch addition of an enriching melt.
To compare against various potential enriching agents, the model is
normalized to an average HREE of
6$\times$primitive mantle, a typical HREE concentration for both
normal MORB [@Sun1989] and alkali basalt [@Farmer1995].
The slope of the resulting normalized profile is diagnostic
of the relative abundance of trace elements in the re-enriching agent.
The normalization factor employed to shift the composition of enriching
fluids to this value is shown in @fig:ree_model|b and is proportional to
the relative amount of material added during re-enrichment (assuming a consistent
composition).

The results of this model confirm that all samples except CK-2 are variably depleted
and re-enriched to some extent, while CK-2 shows neither depletion nor
re-enrichment [@fig:ree_model].
The re-enriched samples have assimilated varying amounts of an enriching
agent with a trace-element pattern similar to alkali basalt. The
pronounced LREE enrichment of samples CK-3 and CK-4 is due to
the lack of REE and low pyroxene modes in the sample, so assimilation of
small masses of enriching melt can greatly increase normalized
abundances.
It is likely that all samples experienced a small (<1% assimilation) interaction with a
fractionated basaltic melt [@fig:ree_model|b]. However, if HREEs have been substantially
enriched (as seems to be the case for sample CK-6) excess LREE is a minimum
constraint on re-enrichment.

Primary depletion degrees of the xenolith samples are estimated by finding
the pMELTS model compositions that best fit the whole-rock HREE, MgO, and
\ce{Al2O3} composition of each sample. Results are summarized
in @tbl:depletion_degrees and show trends superficially similar to
those visible in modal abundance [@fig:modes] and trace element
[@fig:trace_elements] data. The degree of depletion generally increases
with the modeled temperature of the sample, with the notable exception of
sample CK-6, which is by far the least-depleted sample by major-element
proxies and only moderately depleted in heavy rare-earth elements.

### Discussion of trace elements

Clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and recalculated whole-rock rare-earth elements
show variation between samples corresponding to different amounts of depletion
and re-enrichment. For clinopyroxene HREEs, the samples show a range of
depletion in rare-earth elements relative to depleted mantle, following
patterns seen in abyssal peridotites [@Warren2016]. Variably elevated LREE
content of all samples except CK-2 are not seen in abyssal peridotites
[@fig:trace_elements], suggesting that this pattern arose from secondary
re-enrichment by LREE-rich material at depth.

The most pronounced LREE enrichments occur in depleted harzburgites with the
lowest clinopyroxene modes (CK-3 and CK-4). This suggests that these
enrichments arise from the preferential assimilation of rare-earths in sparse
clinopyroxene. Accordingly, our modeling suggests a similar degree of LREE
re-enrichment, corresponding to a volumetrically minor <1% bulk assimilation of
alkali basalt-like material, for all samples except CK-2.

The trace element dataset developed here suggests that the xenolith samples are
residues of progressive fractional melting of primitive mantle at the
mid-ocean ridge, a ssimilar to that recorded in abyssal peridotites
[@Johnson1990; @Warren2016] and easily reconstructed in pMELTS. This
single-stage REE depletion was followed by later LREE re-enrichment by an
enriched melt.

Trace element patterns, aligned with trends in phase composition and modal
abundance, suggest that HREE depletion within the Crystal Knob samples is
primary, without significant re-enrichment. These trends are a proxy for
fertility, and the lherzolite CK-2 is essentially undepleted and apparently has
not been fractionally melted. As in bulk composition, sample CK-6 is an
exception, containing high LREEs in excess of those formed at any stage of
fractional melting. This suggests that CK-6 assimilated a significant amount of
more-evolved melt, and its trace-element profile (including HREE composition)
is formed by refertilization.
