Introduction
============

The tectonic and petrogenetic processes by which Earth’s continental mantle
lithosphere develops through time are of fundamental importance in geodynamics
and Earth history. What are the relative roles of subduction accretion versus
subduction erosion of mantle lithosphere fragments, and what
petrologic-geochemical processes operate to ultimately stabilize mantle
lithosphere beneath newly formed continental crustal tracts?  Volcanic
rock-hosted mantle xenolith suites offer vertical sampling columns that reveal
the compositional and textural states of lithospheric sections at the time of
xenolith entrainment and eruption. Petrogenetic studies of such xenolith suites
offer constraints on depth intervals of entrainment, thermal gradients, and
geochemical evolutionary states. The integration of such constraints with
regional geophysical data, and with tectonic and petrogenetic studies of the
overlying crust offer critical insights into the interplay of plate tectonic
and geodynamic processes responsible for the current state of region specific
lithospheric domains. In this contribution we present new petrologic and
geochemical data on the Pleistocene Crystal Knob volcanic neck-hosted mantle
xenolith locality of coastal central California, and integrate our findings
with regional geophysical data and modeling, and with a wealth of data on the
tectonic and petrogenetic development of the overlying crust.

The Crystal Knob xenolith locality samples a highly strategic lithospheric
column through the Late Cretaceous convergent margin belt of the SW North
American Cordillera. This regionally extensive belt is characterized by a large
volume continental magmatic arc [@Ducea2015] <!-- is this the best ref -->
whose generation was
driven by the eastward subduction of the Farallon oceanic plate beneath western
North America [@Seton2012]. The Franciscan complex represents the
crustal level accretionary complex of this subduction zone, and is widely
recognized for its tectonic inclusion of Farallon plate oceanic basement and
pelagic sediment fragments, as well as upper plate magmatic arc derived
siliciclastic sediments
[@Cowan1978; @Murchey1984; @Sliter1984; @Blake1988; @Chapman2016a]
Recently it has been recognized
that a series of far out of place crystalline nappes that were derived from the
southern California segment of the Late Cretaceous magmatic arc lie
tectonically above Franciscan-affinity accretionary complex rocks in the
central California coastal area
[@Barth2003; @Kidder2006; @Ducea2009; @Chapman2012; @Hall2013].
In aggregate
these crystalline nappes have been called “Salinia”, or the “Salinian terrane”
[@Page1981]. The Crystal Knob xenolith locality lies along the western margin
of Salinia, adjacent to the Nacimiento fault \figref{context}, a polyphase structural
zone that in its original geometry constituted the local structural base of the
Salinia crystalline nappe sequence [@Hall2013]. In this setting
the crystal Knob xenolith suite samples the uppermost mantle that has been
constructed beneath both the Franciscan accretionary complex and its local
veneer of Salinia crystalline nappes.

## Regional tectonic setting and the application of mantle xenolith studies

The SW North American Cordillera is endowed with an abundance of xenolith
localities wherein upper mantle-lower crustal rock fragments were entrained in
mainly late Cenozoic volcanic eruptions. Early studies of a number of these
xenolith suites focused on the systematizing of petrographic features and
classifying various samples into petrographic groups [@Wilshire1988].
Subsequent application of modern geochemical and petrogenetic techniques has
led to the recognition of distinct regional mantle lithosphere domains
consisting of pre-Phanerozoic lithosphere, Cretaceous arc mantle wedge,
underplated Farallon plate nappes, and late Cenozoic shallow convective
asthenosphere
[@Galer1989; @Livaccari1993; @Alibert1994; @Beard1995; @Ducea1996, @Ducea1998a; @Jove1998; @Lee2001; @Lee2006; @Usui2003; @Luffi2009].
In general there is a geologically reasonable correspondence between such upper
mantle domains and surface geology, with sub-continental suites having been
erupted through cratonic and peri-cratonic crust, mantle wedge suites erupted
through the Cretaceous large volume batholith, and asthenospheric suites
erupted through active rifts. In contrast, xenolith suites derived from
underplated Farallon plate mantle nappes have thus far only been recovered from
more inboard crustal domains, requiring large sub-horizontal displacements and
underplating along relatively shallow subduction megathrust systems. Crystal
Knob, having erupted through the Franciscan subduction accretionary complex,
presents a rare opportunity to sample mantle lithosphere directly beneath the
region of long-lived subduction accretion proximal to the plate edge.

The tectonic setting of the sub-Crystal Knob mantle lithosphere is best posed
by the restoration of its host crustal rocks to a pre-San Andreas transform
offset position, outboard of the northern reaches of the southern California
batholith (Figures \ref{fig:context} and \ref{fig:reconstruction}, detailed below).
The southern California batholith
is the southern continuation of the Sierra Nevada batholith across the Garlock
fault. In this restored position the crystalline nappes that constitute Salinia
correlate to deeply exhumed Cretaceous arc plutonic rocks of the southernmost
Sierra Nevada batholith and the northwestern zones of the southern California
batholith, widely exposed in ranges of the Mojave plateau
[@Saleeby2003; @Barbeau2005; @Chapman2012]. These deeply exhumed batholithic
rocks all share a common regional upper plate position above a polyphase low
angle fault system below which Franciscan-affinity, mainly metaclastic rocks,
were tectonically underplated in the Late Cretaceous
[@Malin1995; @Barth2003; @Yan2005; @Ducea2009; @Chapman2010; @Chapman2012 @Chapman2016b].
The underplated metaclastic rocks are exposed in a series of windows
that are labeled as subduction channel schists on Figure 1. Detritus for the
schist protoliths was derived from the upper plate batholithic belt that was
vigorously uplifted above a shallow flat segment of the greater Franciscan
subduction megathrust system [@Barth2003; @Saleeby2007; @Chapman2013; @Chapman2016a].
The underplated schists tectonically encase blocks and
nappes of Farallon plate oceanic basement and sediments. The shallow flat
subduction megathrust segment is attributed to the ephemeral buoyancy effect
resulting from the subduction of the conjugate massif to the Shatsky Rise
oceanic LIP [@Livaccari1981; @Sliter1984; @Saleeby2003], which is
currently resolved in deep seismic tomographic images beneath the interior of
North America [@Liu2010]. The tectonic position and state of structural
attenuation of the Salinia nappes, as well as adjacent (Salinia restored
position) deeply exhumed batholithic rocks, derives from both shallow
subduction megathrust displacements, and subsequent large magnitude
trench-directed extensional faulting that correlates in time to the Shatsky
conjugate progressing deeper into the mantle beneath the North American plate
[@Saleeby2003; @Liu2010; @Chapman2012].

The relatively shallow level of the tectonic underplating of the schists
directly beneath deep crustal large volume batholithic rocks requires the prior
tectonic erosion of the mantle lithosphere (mantle wedge) that hosted the
source regime for the overlying batholith. Integrated mantle xenolith studies
and deep seismic imaging document this process.  Late Miocene small volume
volcanic flows and plugs from the central Sierra Nevada batholith (Fig. 3)
carry xenolith suites that sampled the Cretaceous mantle wedge of the overlying
batholith [@Ducea1996, @Ducea1998a; @Lee2001, @Lee2006; @Saleeby2003].
The central and northern regions of the batholith are currently
exposed over shallow to medial crustal depths (2 to 4 kb pressure), whereas at
its southern reaches traversing towards the Garlock fault, a continuous
gradient to deep levels (10 kb) is exposed [@Nadin2008]. At these
deep levels the structural base of the batholith consists of the normal sense
remobilized shallow subduction megathrust, beneath which lie the underplated
schists [@Saleeby2003; @Chapman2010, @Chapman2012, @Chapman2016b]. Seismic reflection
data image the megathrust as effectively flat beneath the western Mojave
plateau [@Yan2005], and dipping ~30ºN beneath the southernmost Sierra
Nevada region [@Malin1995]. The Garlock fault (Fig. 1a) nucleated during
the early Miocene along the inflection in the megathrust [@Saleeby2016],
with the inflection constituting a lateral ramp in the subduction
megathrust system [@Saleeby2003; @Chapman2016b]. In contrast to the
central Sierra xenolith suite, mantle xenoliths recovered from the eastern
margin of the southern California batholith record the tectonic erosion of
sub-continental mantle lithosphere (including Cretaceous mantle wedge), and the
underplating of Farallon plate mantle lithosphere [@Shervais1973; @Luffi2009].
More specifically the Dish Hill suite (Fig. 1) samples an upper
mantle duplex with imbricated nappes of Farallon plate oceanic mantle lying in
structural sequence beneath a relatively thin roof of attenuated continental
lithosphere peridotites. The mantle duplex is interpreted to have formed as the
Farallon plate retreated following Shatsky conjugate low-angle subduction
[@Luffi2009]. The reconstructed position of Crystal Knob, directly outboard of the Dish Hill locality [Fig. 1], as well as the neck having
penetrated the Franciscan accretionary complex, clearly poses the question of
the Crystal Knob suite having sampled additional underplated Farallon mantle
nappes, in structural sequence with the Dish Hill mantle duplex.

Mantle xenoliths of the eastern Sierra suite (Fig. 3), viewed in the context of late
Cenozoic plate kinematics of the southern California region [@Argus1991; @Atwater1998]
pose another viable possibility for the sub-Crystal Knob upper mantle. The eastern Sierra suite occurs in
Pliocene-Quaternary mafic lava flows, and records a significantly steeper
thermal gradient and compositions much closer to that of the convecting mantle
than the Cretaceous mantle wedge suite from the central Sierra
(@Ducea1996, @Ducea1998b). Seismic data from the eastern Sierra region
reveal asthenospheric mantle extending upwards to the base of the crust at ~30 km
depth [@Jones1998; @Zandt2004; @Frassetto2011; @Jones2014],
consistent with the eastern Sierra xenolith suite findings.
The eastern Sierra (suite) eruption sites encompass the <10 Ma old
Owens Valley rift system (Fig. 1a), which is driven by upper mantle convection.
Convective ascent of asthenosphere to relatively shallow levels and late
Cenozoic regional volcanism of the central to southern California region are
correlated to the opening of the Pacific-Farallon slab window
[@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005].  Both eruption of the Crystal Knob
neck and the origin of its upper mantle underpinnings could also owe their origins to
asthenosphere ascended into a slab window.

Below we employ petrologic and
geochemical investigations on the Crystal Knob suite, in conjunction with
regional findings on other xenolith locations as well as geophysical data and
modeling in order to pursue the origin of the upper mantle beneath the Crystal
Knob eruption site.

<!--[[context]]-->

<!--[[field_photo]]-->

The Crystal Knob neck (35.806º N, 121.174º W) is a mid-Pleistocene
olivine--plagioclase phyric basalt which erupted along the margin of the
Franciscan assemblage 500 m west of the Nacimiento Fault in the Santa Lucia
Mountains of central California [@Seiders1989]. The basaltic plug is ~80
m in diameter at the surface and has entrained abundant dunite and sparse
spinel peridotite xenoliths \figp{field_photo}. The dunites are cumulates, and
texturally they grade into single grain xenocrysts, or the apparent
phenocrysts, for the host lava. The spinel peridotites are volumetrically
subordinate to the dunites. As discussed below, the peridotites lack textural
features suggestive of igneous cumulate origin, and in conjunction with the
compositional data presented below we interpret the peridotites as mantle
lithosphere in origin.

#### Host Lava

The ages of host lavas for mantle xenolith suites are critical for the
application of their petrogenesis to tectonic and geodynamic processes
(for example see @Ducea1998b).
The age of the Crystal Knob host lava was determined
using the $^{40}$Ar/$^{39}$Ar radioisotope technique on in situ <!--?--> 
plagioclase phenocrysts. A billet
of the host lava (sample CK-1) was provided to the USGS Geochronology
Laboratory in Denver, Colorado. Plagioclase feldspar grains
were selected from the sample and irradiated in the USGS TRIGA reactor.
The samples were
step-heated using an infrared laser \figp{step_heating}, and $^{39}$Ar loss was
measured simultaneously on a Thermo Scientific Argus VI using 4 Faraday
detectors (m/e 40-37) and ion counting (m/e 36). The detectors were
intercalibrated using standard gas and air pipettes. The measurements
are corrected for blanks above baselines, radioactive decay, and
nucleogenic interferences, and standardized against a Fish Canyon
sanidine with an age of 28.20 Ma.  Non-radiogenic argon assumed to have
$^{40}$Ar/$^{39}$Ar = 298.56 (atmospheric composition) [@Cosca2011].

Data for stepwise heating are presented in Table x, and are presented
graphically in Figure x . Our preferred age of 1.65±0.06 Ma is defined
by the twelve intermediate out of fifteen heating steps, for which the
entire spectrum define a similar age, within error, of 1.71 Ma. From
these age data we infer that the Crystal Knob lavas entrained xenoliths
from the immediately underlying upper mantle at ca. 1.7 Ma,
or mid-Pleistocene time.

Methods
=======

<!-- ## Petrography --> Polished thin sections of 250 µm thickness were
prepared for the basaltic host lava (CK-1), six peridotite xenolith
(CK-2 through CK-7), and two dunite cumulate (CK-D1 and CK-D2) samples.
The samples were evaluated under a petrographic microscope to determine
their textural and mineralogic variation. Electron backscatter intensity
images were collected using a ZEISS 1550 VP field emission SEM. For each
sample, modal mineralogy was estimated by classifying mineralogy on a
\~5000 pixel grid atop coregistered optical scans and electron
backscatter mosaics \figref{textures}. Volumetric modes were converted
to weight percents using representative densities for spinel-facies
peridotites. <!--Maybe show these densities? --> Results are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:modes}. <!--Should make a table about this-->

<!--[[textures]]-->

<!--[[sample_petrography]]-->

<!-- ## Electron microprobe --> Major-element mineral compositions were
analyzed for each thin section on a five-spectrometer JEOL JXA-8200
electron-probe microanalyzer at the California Institute of Technology.
Abundances were counted in wavelength-dispersive mode using a probe
current of 15 kV. The instrument was calibrated using natural and
synthetic standards; matrix corrections were made using the CITZAF
[@Armstrong1988] algorithm. 1714 measurements were performed across the
six peridotite samples, concentrated in 3-4 locations of interest per
sample. <!-- 403 measurements of dunites and the basalt host were also taken,
but are not reported in this study. -->
Areas with orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in contact were emphasized to
aid in thermometry. Whole-rock major-element abundances are
reconstructed from mineral composition and estimated modes.
Representative mineral and recalculated whole-rock compositions are
tabulated in Table \ref{tab:minerals}.

<!-- ## SIMS -->
Trace element concentrations were acquired for pyroxene grains
in each xenolith sample,
using a Cameca IMS-7f-GEO magnetic-sector secondary ion mass
spectrometer (SIMS) at the California Institute of Technology. Two to
three each of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene grains were targeted per
xenolith sample. Measurements were acquired with 9 kV beam flux and a
100 µm spot size. The USGS glass standard NIST 610 was used as an
external standard for all elements [@Gao2002]<!-- this ref is for
LA-ICP-MS -->. Minimal variation in measured concentration was observed
at grain and sample scale, though clinopyroxene in CK-6 and
orthopyroxene in CK-7 show differences outside of analytical error in
Ba, La, and Ce (potentially attributable to concentrations near SIMS
detection limits). Other measurements are largely concordant and results
are presented as within-sample averages. Whole-rock trace element
abundances are estimated using measured concentrations in clinopyroxene
and orthopyroxene and mineral modes. Olivine is ignored in calculations
because rare-earth elements (REEs) are 2-3 orders of magnitude less
compatible than in clinopyroxene [@WittEickschen2005;@Luffi2009].
Results for measured pyroxene and recalculated whole-rock trace elements
are shown in Table \ref{tab:trace_elements}.

<!--## Isotopes-->
Portions of each peridotite sample were crushed using
a shatterbox at the California Institute of Technology. Clinopyroxene
grains (150--300 µm, 35-45 g per sample and free of visible
inclusions and alteration) were picked by hand under a binocular
microscope. These clinopyroxene separates were analyzed for strontium
and neodymium isotopes at the University of Arizona, Tuscon. The samples were
spiked with mixed $^{147}$Sm-$^{150}$Nd tracers [@Wasserburg1981]. <!--
Maybe some more info from Mihai? --> Samarium was analyzed using a
static routine on a 54 VG Sector multicollector thermal ionization mass
spectrometer (TIMS), and neodymium was measured as an oxide on a 354 VG
Sector instrument. Results are presented in Table \ref{tab:isotopes}.

# Results

<!--[[modes]]-->

## Petrography

Six peridotite samples (CK-2 through CK-7) were collected and analyzed.
As collected, samples were 5-10 cm diameter friable peridotites with
medium (200 µm -- 1 mm) <!-- check this --> grains. Additionally,
several samples consisting of the host lava (CK-1) and containing
fragments of peridotite and dunite cumulates (CK-D1 and CK-D2) were
prepared.

<!-- (Daven, we should have a table that lists all samples, and gives a
petrographic overview) -->

Thin sections of each peridotite sample were texturally classified using
the scheme of @Pike1977. All samples display an allotriomorphic granular
texture with anisotropy or visible zoning largely absent. There is no preferred
orientation in silicate grains, although several samples (notably CK-2
and CK-5) exhibit a weak shape-preferred orientation in elongate
spinels. <!-- Which? -->

<!-- (Daven, we should state whether or not three are petrographically
observed plastic deformation features in the peridotites) -->

Minor late-stage alteration products are seen in all peridotite samples.
This includes variably Fe-rich grain boundaries of major phases and Ti
enrichment in pyroxene rims (\<10 µm from the grain
edge). Sample CK-4 contains an alteration channel which cuts linearly
across the thin section. This channel is bounded by resorbed boundaries
of the major phases (olivine and orthopyroxene) and hosts
microcrystalline clinopyroxene, 10 µm euhedral spinels,
and minor amphibole. Near this melt channel, thin streamers of
intergranular fill show compositions enriched in Na and Ti. These
fills are present (but less extensive) in sample CK-3, and
generally absent in other samples. Samples other than CK-3 and CK-4
largely do not show melt infiltration along grain boundaries, instead
having major phases in contact (though most are fractured along these surfaces).
All samples, but most notably CK-3 and CK-4, have clinopyroxene grains
that are strongly intergrown with orthopyroxene. <!-- check this
statement -->
Sample CK-7 is notable for
the abundance of exsolution lamellae and graphic recrystallization of
orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene.

Petrographic study of the host lava and cumulate samples reveals
products of multiple stages of melt generation. Sample CK-1 includes
abundant phenocrysts and xenocrysts of olivine, as well as small (\<1 cm)
dunite and peridotite fragments. Samples CK-D1 and CK-D2 are similar but
also contain larger (up to 2 cm) dunite and peridotite fragments. The
peridotite fragments include both relatively pristine textures similar
to those in samples CK-2 to CK-7, to poikilitic and resorbed grains with
prominent reaction rims. Taken together, these samples appear to
represent interactions with the melt throughout their history.

Lithologic classifications were determined using modal
mineralogy. The samples range from lherzolites to clinopyroxene
harzburgites and are dominated by olivine and orthopyroxene. All samples
contain minor (\<1%$_\textrm{wt}$) spinel. CK-2 has the most fertile
composition, with 12.2\percentwt{} clinopyroxene. CK-3 is the least
fertile sample, with 0.91\percentwt{} clinopyroxene. Olivine modes range
from 65 to 75\percentwt{}. Grain size varies between samples but
generally has a characteristic scale of 200 µm. The
harzburgite CK-3 contains 2 mm orthopyroxene
porphyroblasts. All samples are Type I peridotites in the @Frey1978
classification system.

<!-- abundant phenocrysts and xenocrysts of olivine, as well as zoned
pyroxenes. -->
The dunites have a cumulate texture and
no spinel or pyroxene. This texture corresponds to a well-sampled trendline of
host-lava phenocrysts from xenolith composition to progressively lower
Fo\# cumulates \figref{major_elements}.
It is also clear that the melt fractionation history was relatively
complex. Zoned clinopyroxene grains show a stepwise crystallization
history in a progressively evolving magma \figref{cpx_profile}.
These features suggest a history of melt fractionation.

## Major elements

<!--[[minerals]]-->
<!--[[lava_minerals]]-->
<!--[[major_elements]]-->

For electron microprobe data, error includes both analytical and sampling errors.
Mg\# (molar Mg/(Mg+Fe) $\cdot$ 100) ranges from 87 to 91. Within each
sample, a consistent Mg\# for all silicate phases is indicative of Fe-Mg
equilibrium. All samples contain \<1\percentwt{} spinel. A range of
spinel Cr\# (molar Cr/(Cr+Al) $\cdot{}$ 100) from 10 to 27 likewise
implies variation in degree of partial melting between samples
[@Dick1984].

<!-- Sample CK-4 is the most depleted, with a distinct signature of melt
extraction -->

We correct spinel Mg\# from total iron to ferrous iron basis using stoichiometric
balance: excess Fe is removed from the octahedral site and added to the tetrahedral
until $\Sigma \textrm{cations} = 3$ with a 4-oxygen basis. This correction results
in spinel Mg\# between 75 and 81, slightly higher than the uncorrected value.

<!--[[whole_rock_major]]-->

<!--[[spinel_cr]]-->

<!--[[step_heating]]-->
<!--[[cpx_profile]]-->

## Trace Elements

<!--[[spider]]-->

Clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and recalculated whole-rock rare-earth element show several modes of
variation between samples, corresponding to different amounts of
depletion and re-enrichment.
All samples show clear evidence of rare-earth element
depletion, although the amount of this depletion varies.
The cooler samples show progressive depletion in light rare-earth
elements (LREEs) and undepleted heavy rare-earths (HREEs). The warmer
samples show progressive HREE depletion and enrichment in LREEs. These
trends are inverted, so CK-4, the most HREE-depleted sample, is also the
most LREE-enriched.

<!-- Maybe this paragraph should go lower? --> This pattern suggests
that the cooler samples were depleted of (relatively more incompatible)
LREEs as residues of progressive fractional melting [@Johnson1990].
The warmer group of samples underwent a multistage history of
wholesale REE depletion (due to higher-degree melting) followed by later
LREE re-enrichment. This overprinting relationship is similar to that
observed in mid-ocean ridge peridotites, with ridge crest depletion
followed by off axis refertilization via infiltration of low-melt
fraction magmas [@Luffi2009]. However, this relationship may also have
arisen during melt extraction and entrainment prior <!--(confusing, do
you mean during eruption/entrainment here?)--> to eruption. The latter
seems to demand a significant residence time of the hotter xenoliths in,
or proximal to, a magma chamber at depth to allow LREE
refertilization.

## Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopes

<!--[[isotopes]]-->

Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd radiogenic isotope data for clinopyroxene separates show
these samples to be derived from the depleted convecting mantle. All
samples are enriched in radiogenic \ce{^{143}Nd}
($\epsilon_{\textrm{Nd}}$ from 10.3 to 11.0) and depleted in
\ce{^{87}Sr} (\ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .702). This pattern of strong
depletion in large-ion-lithophile elements rules out a continental
lithosphere or Mesozoic mantle wedge source and suggests an origin in the
asthenospheric or underplated oceanic mantle
[@DePaolo1976b;@McCulloch1978].

<!--[[isotopes_table]]-->

## Thermometry

Electron-microprobe major-element data is used as the basis for pyroxene
Ca--exchange geothermometry. Several formulations of this reaction are
tested \tabref{thermometry}: BKN [@Brey1990] and TA98 [@Taylor1998] are
formulated based on empirical calibration of the two-pyroxene Ca exchange
reaction in simple and natural systems. @Taylor1998 is explicitly calibrated to
account for errors arising from high Al content.
The Ca-in-orthopyroxene (Ca-OPX) thermometer [@Brey1990] is formulated for
use in the absence of clinopyroxene.
Together, these thermometers can query the full range of major-element compositions
seen in the Crystal Knob dataset.

<!--[[thermometry]]-->

Core and rim measurements are separated to assess within-sample
temperature disequilibrium and late-stage (e.g. eruptive) heating. Analytical errors (caused by
uncertainty in microprobe data) are small, on the order of 5ºC (1$\sigma$).
Other sources of error include the calibration of the thermometer
and potential bias from within-sample disequilibrium. @Taylor1998
reports residuals of calibration of the thermometer to experimental
data which yield total errors of 50-60ºC (1$\sigma$). Unreported calibration errors for the
BKN and Ca-OPX thermometers are likely similar in scale. In practice,
error distributions based on calibration with heterogeneous experimental
samples likely form an upper bound on relative errors. Within-sample scatter in measured temperatures
can be used to estimate the relative error of the thermometer, and the relative
performance of different thermometers can be used to assess the recovery of absolute temperatures.

Per-sample temperature distributions are
constructed by calculating a separate temperature for each individual nearest-neighbor
pair of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene.
Analytical errors are propagated through the calculation.
The resulting distribution of temperatures (with *n* ranging from 19 to 74 pairs per
group) accounts for within-sample variations and provides an
approximation of measurement precision.

TA98 and BKN temperatures have a strong linear relationship, with BKN
temperature estimates higher by up to 50ºC.
The disparity decreases
towards higher temperatures and conforms to the relationship between
the two thermometers found by @Nimis2010.
This relationship can be expressed as
$\textrm{T}_\textrm{BKN} = 0.9~\textrm{T}_\textrm{TA98} + 145$ for temperatures
in ºC.
@Nimis2010 shows that TA98 performs well against
experimental results in several scenarios and advises its use over BKN.
The Ca-in-OPX thermometer generally yields results in between BKN and TA98,
with little within-sample scatter, possibly the result of fast diffusion
of small amounts of Ca in orthopyroxene. <!-- *** --->

Average TA98 temperatures range from 957 to 1063ºC for cores and
955 to 1054ºC for rims \tabp{thermometry}.
CK-2 core temperatures indicate more complete
equilibration, with a standard deviation of only 2.3ºC (compared
with 8.2-12.4ºC for all other samples). Temperatures are distributed roughly normally
for most samples, but outlying clusters of measurements in CK-4 and CK-6 may indicate
disequilibrium at millimeter scale.
In CK-4, a few grain cores with TA98
temperatures of 1100ºC are likely related to late-stage diffusion during
entrainment and eruption.
High and variable rim compositions may also be related to the eruption event.
Several samples show a wide spread rim temperatures, perhaps
indicating differential exposure to interstital fluids.
This internal variability is minor: for grain cores in all samples,
the mean of pairwise analyses is within a few degrees
of the temperature calculated by averaging all pyroxenes across the sample.
This implies that the bulk of the temperature signature
is based on the equilibrium state of the sample.

The samples show an apparent bimodal
distribution in equilibration temperature, forming distinct groups
centered at 970ºC and 1060ºC (TA98) \figref{temp_summary}.
The cooler group contains CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7, while the hotter
contains CK-3, CK-4, and CK-6.
This division between these two groups is robust and apparent in all thermometers.
The high-temperature samples show re-enrichment in LREEs and contain chromian spinels.
This temperature distribution may signify two distinct depths of origin for
the studied xenoliths. Throughout this paper, the samples are color-coded, with
blue-green corresponding to the low-temperature array, and red-yellow representing
the high-temperature samples.

### REE-in-pyroxene thermometry

We use the @Liang2013 REE-in-two-pyroxene thermometer to estimate the
equilibration temperature of the samples using an independent system.
The relative immobility of REEs allows assessment
of equilibrium temperatures over longer timescales than those queried
with two-pyroxene cation exchange thermometry.


- Calculate a per-element equilibrium temperature
- Best fitting line from zero through the data cloud gives sample
  equilibrium temperature

- Robust regression using a Tukey biweight norm


Sample CK-4 shows major disequilibrium in the light and medium REEs, with only
elements heavier than Ho retaining an equilibrium signature.

- In some samples, notably CK-3 and CK-4, LREE show much higher
  equilibration temperatures than HREE
- CK-4 had excess LREE added, causing re-equilibration of LREEs
- This occurred to a lesser extent with CK-3
- Change in temperature?
  - A fossil heating event that was retained due to the large size of LILE
- Due to kinetics of two thermometers, this must have happened before
  re-equilibration of major elements (right??)
- Change in partition coefficients due to other means
  - Some weird melt interaction favoring extraction of LREE from
    clinopyroxene and driving up relative abundance of LREE in
    orthopyroxene

- Europium disequilibrium
  - interesting sidebar to REE thermometry
  - distinct disequilibrium in Eu
  - favors Eu in Opx by a factor of 10
  - different partition coefficient for Eu
  - Eu, because of its two oxidiation states, can behave differently
  - suggests a significant amount of Eu 2+ exists in the samples
  - much more reducing environment in general (Asimow and Blundy,
    personal communication)

### Depth constraints

<!--[[depth]]-->

Peridotite barometers are based on the decreasing Al content of
orthopyroxene with depth [@Nickel1985; @Brey1990; @Nimis2000]. However, in
the absence of garnet, the reaction is purely thermometric, with nearly
vertical isopleths in P-T space [@Herzberg1978; @Gasparik2000]. With no
reliable geobarometers for spinel peridotites, several less robust
measures are used to evaluate the depth of the xenolith source.

Minimum entrainment depths must be greater than ~30 km, the depth of both the
Moho near the eruption site [@Trehu1991] and the plagioclase-spinel
peridotite facies transition
[@Green1970a]. The xenolith entrainment depth must exceed the boundary of spinel stability,
which is composition-dependent and poorly constrained for natural systems,
but thought to lie over the 50-80 km depth interval
[@ONeill1981; @Kinzler1997; @Gasparik2000; @Klemme2004].

<!--[[ree_temperatures]]-->

Projection of TA98 temperatures onto a geotherm using a surface heat
flux [@Turcotte2002] of 90 mW/m^2, corresponding to measured heat flows
in the study region [@Erkan2009] yields model depths ranging from 31-39
km \figref{depth}. However, the surface temperatures that the heat flow
data are based on may be transient.
<!-- could go into things here but may get into this later -->


The Coast Ranges are geologically active and may be affected by
geothermal and erosional processes. Recent increases in erosion such as
those documented post 2 Ma in the Santa Lucia Range [@Ducea2003b]
could significantly raise the geothermal gradient in the Coast Ranges.

The geothermal gradient may be affected by differences in regional thermal conductivity
@Lachenbruch1980 concluded that CRTA could not be generated by
conductive fault heating alone, but was also hesitant to invoke fluid
flow to explain a regionally averaged thermal gradient.
@Kennedy1997 shows the presence of mantle fluids in the San Andreas
fault zone, giving credence to the idea deep fluid transport.

All of these potential estimation effects for a geothermal gradient have
the effect of making it look more pronounced than it really is. Thus, it
seems likely that the gradients shown are a maximum limit on allowed
geothermal gradient.

<!-- This text in the parens is confusing, and needs to be more clearly written with some specific point in mind)) -->

Equilibration pressure measurements are attempted for the peridotite
xenoliths using the @Kohler1990 Ca-in-olivine
barometer. This barometer is explicitly calibrated for spinel
peridotites but widely disregarded based on poor resolution,
vulnerability to late-stage diffusion, and dependence on low Ca
concentrations in olivine [@Medaris1999; @OReilly1997].
This technique yields a broad distribution in model depths,
largely coincident with the spinel stability field \figref{depth}.
The low-temperature samples in particular have significant scatter
towards model depth below the spinel-in isograd.
The depth distributions are largely normal, with modes
ranging from 35 to 52 km.
The low and high-temperature cohorts remain separable, with high-temperature
samples generally showing deeper equilibrium depths.

To convert between depth and pressure, we assume a constant geobaric
gradient of 30 km/GPa.

<!-- This paragraph needs more -->
The Cr\# of the hotter samples expands the stability field of
spinel against garnet to deeper depths. Several studies have attempted to estimate
the magnitude of this effect [@Klemme2000; @Klemme2004; @ONeill1981].
Figure \ref{depth} shows the depth increases estimated by the
simplified method given in  @ONeill1981, showing that potential depths increase by up to
10 km. If these deeper depths are valid, the outlined
geotherm conforms generally to temperature bounds of 700--1100ºC
measured by seismic tomography at 50--100 km depth for coastal
California [@Goes2002].

ties to what is shown on Figure 14. Also the Fig. 14 caption needs more,

Discussion
==========

## Petrology

The peridotite samples from Crystal Knob show a range of depletion in
major and trace elements. They are isotopically depleted, with an
$\epsilon_\mathrm{Nd}$ of
+10, and \ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .7029. <!-- (Daven, the Nd and Sr
data in Table 4 are given as measured. In the table you should also show
the time corrected Nd and Sr isotopic ratios and epslon Nd  value for a
correction of 1.65 Ma. You should then refer to these time corrected
numbers in the text and show these values on the Figure 10 Eps Nd-Sr
plot. The corrections will be small, but since we have dated the host it
would be best to use the time corrected values for time of entrainment.
--> This corresponds to the depleted asthenosphere, or convecting upper mantle of Hoffman (2004), with a
mantle upwelling source that has seen no contribution from the western
North American crust or continental lithosphere more generally.

Pyroxene-exchange geothermometry shows that the peridotite samples form
two groups in temperature with centroids separated by roughly 60ºC.
These temperatures seem to correspond to the samples being sourced along
a depth gradient. For reasonable slopes of the sub-Salinian geotherm,
this range of temperatures may sample a depth range of 5-15 km within
the mantle lithosphere. These depths must be greater than 30 km, the
depth to the Moho, <!-- appropriate reference --> and less than
60-90 km based on the composition-dependent lower limit of the spinel stability field.

### Rare-earth temperature

Rare-earth exchange thermometry shows the same two groupings of
temperatures. Temperatures measured for the low-temperature cohort are
most comparable to the TA98 results. Given that the TA98 method has been
found to perform best among the pyroxene-exchange thermometers by
@Nimis2010, it seems likely that both the TA98 and REE temperatures show
long-term equilibrium with no significant thermal perturbations. For the
high-temperature cohort, particularly samples CK-4 and CK-6, the REE
method shows significantly higher equilibration temperatures than the
TA98 method. Rare-earths in pyroxene diffuse several orders of magnitude
slower than major elements [@Liang2013], so early thermal events can
leave an imprint on the distribution of rare-earths for much longer than
with major elements. It is likely that these higher temperatures are a
signature of a fossil heating event primarily affecting the deepest
samples. This is accompanied by major REE disequilibrium in sample CK-4,
which also contains the most intergranular melt channels.

Sample CK-4 records a significantly higher temperature for LREE than the
other samples and its HREE equilibration temperatures. This signifies
that LREEs were equilibrated at a much higher temperature than the
HREEs. This pronounced within-sample disequilibrium could be the result
of metasomatic processes, which is bolstered by the fact that CK-4 has
the only significant melt-infiltration textures in the sample set. It is
likely, therefore, that CK-4 was subjected to a short, transient heating
event that was not fully equilibrated in HREE. Further, since this
transient heating is not reflected in major-element temperatures, it is
likely that the sample was heated transiently and equilibrated at a
lower temperature for a significant period of time. Also, given low CPX modes,
rare-earths added during refertilization may not be completely
homogenized throughout the sample.

### Trace elements

For clinopyroxenes, the low-temperature cohort ranges from essentially
undepleted (CK-7 has a flat chondrite-normalized REE profile) to low
levels of depletion characteristic of the least-depleted abyssal
peridotites \figp{cpx_literature_comparison}. The high-temperature
cohort seems to have been both depleted (based on low HREE
concentrations) and re-enriched in trace elements to a much greater
degree than the low-temperature samples.

<!-- (Daven, do you think that the high-T group attained its signature
at the Farallon-Pacific spreading ridge, or from re-heating of
underplated Farallon mantle by the slab window convection event?). -->


In whole-rock space, the relationship between sample temperature and level of
depletion is less clear.
Combining pyroxene trace-element measurements with modal mineralogy
suggests that pyroxene modes have changed significantly in response to
depletion, making recalculated whole-rock trace elements a valuable tool
to assess the overall level of depletion in the sample.
Sample CK-5 in particular is much more depleted in whole-rock
composition than its cpx trace-element composition would suggest, due to
low clinopyroxene modes.

### Modeling depletion and re-enrichment

A depletion model is constructed
in *alphaMELTS* [@Smith2005b] to illuminate the probable depletion and
re-enrichment paths of the Crystal Knob sample.
A generic model of peridotite depletion is constructed, in which
a parcel of material starting at a mantle
potential temperature of 1470ºC at 3.0 GPa
and a depleted MORB mantle composition [@Workman2005] is
tracked along an isentropic fractional melting path with a melt porosity of 1%.
These starting parameters were chosen to provide the best correspondence
with the overall experimental dataset.

The HREE (Er--Lu) composition of Crystal Knob xenolith samples are fit
to model step along this adiabatic path using least-squares error
minimization.
Since HREEs are not likely to be
easily modified by late re-enrichment due to their low diffusion rates,
the best-fitting model step is used as an estimate of single-stage
depletion of the samples during decompression melting. 

The difference between the sample composition and this fitted depleted
profile is taken as the contribution from batch addition of an
enriching fluid. The REE concentrations of the enriching agent are then
normalized to an average of 12$\times$primitive mantle.
The normalization factor employed to shift the composition of enriching
fluids to this value is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ree_trends} and corresponds
roughly to the amount of LREE added during re-enrichment.

The results of this model show that
the samples are variably depleted and all except CK-2 are re-enriched to
some extent \figp{ree_model}. CK-2 appears to be in equilibrium with mid-ocean ridge
basalt while the others appear to be in equilibrium with an enriching
agent similar to alkali basalt. The strong exponential increase in the
presumed LREE composition of our enriching material shows that the
re-enrichment is likely better modeled as a fractional process. Variable
amounts of interaction with the enriched fluid are required to explain
the observed level of re-enrichment, with the most seen by samples CK-3
and CK-4 \figp{ree_trends}.

Primary depletion degrees of the xenolith samples are estimated by finding
the model compositions which best fit the whole-rock HREE, MgO, and
\ce{Al2O3} composition of each sample. Results are summarized
in Table \ref{tab:depletion degrees} and are superficially similar to
the trends visible in modal abundance \figp{modes} and trace element
\figp{spider} data. The degree of depletion generally increases
with the modeled temperature of the sample, with the notable exception of
sample CK-6, which is by far the least-depleted sample by major-element
proxies and only moderately depleted in heavy rare-earth elements,
although it has the hottest modeled temperature.

Sample CK-6, although relatively fertile,
has much higher iron than the other samples. This makes
it seem likely that it was re-enriched from a more evolved source than
the baseline primitive mantle.

<!--[[ree_model]]-->
<!--[[ree_trends]]-->

<!--[[depletion_degrees]]-->

The overall pattern of trace elements suggests that the xenolith samples are residues of progressive
fractional melting of primitive mantle to form abyssal peridotites [@Johnson1990].
The samples underwent
a multistage history of wholesale REE depletion (due to higher-degree
melting) followed by later LREE re-enrichment by an enriched fluid.
This overprint is similar
to that gained by emplacement at a mid-ocean ridge followed by
refertilization by off-axis magmatism [@Luffi2009]. However, it may also
have arisen during melt extraction and entrainment prior to eruption.
The latter seems to demand a significant residence time of the hotter
xenoliths in a magma chamber at depth to allow LREE refertilization.

## Origin of mantle lithosphere beneath the Crystal Knob volcanic neck

Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic data on peridotite xenoliths from this study
demonstrate that the mantle lithosphere that was sampled by the Crystal
Knob volcanic neck is sourced from the depleted convecting mantle with
no contribution from recycled crustal material, nor ancient
sub-continental mantle lithosphere. This is consistent with the neck
having penetrated through the Franciscan accretionary complex, and also
with the observations that Salinia continental arc rocks of the region
are unrooted nappes that lie structurally above Franciscan complex
rocks. In that the Franciscan complex of the region was assembled by
long-lived subduction of the Farallon plate encompassing
Cretaceous-early Tertiary time [@Cowan1978; @Saleeby1986; @Seton2012; @Chapman2016a],
it follows that the mantle lithosphere of the region was constructed from partly subducted Farallon
plate upper mantle at some point late in the Franciscan accretionary
history, or by some other mechanism following the cessation of Farallon
plate subduction. The geologic history of the region integrated with
crustal structure constraints pose viable alternatives for these
mechanisms.

## Late Cenozoic tectonic history and regional crustal structure

In Oligocene to early Miocene time the Pacific-Farallon spreading ridge
obliquely impinged into the SW Cordillera subduction zone leading to the
development of the San Andreas transform system [@Atwater1970]. Ridge
impingement was kinematically complex due to large offset ridge-ridge
transforms, resulting in the opening of a geometrically complex slab
window as well as the production of the Monterey microplate, which
nucleated as an oblique intra-oceanic rift along an ~250 km long segment
of the Pacific-Farallon ridge [@Thorkelson1989; @Bohannon1995; @Atwater1998; @Wilson2005].
Late Cenozoic volcanism of the coastal region of central California has been
linked to slab window formation by the partial melting of asthenosphere
as it ascended into the slab window [@Wilson2005].
Alternatively, it has been suggested that microplate formation along the
impinging Pacific-Farallon ridge was more dominant than slab window
formation, and that these microplates stalled beneath coastal central
California as the Farallon plate continued to subduct deeper into the
mantle [@Bohannon1995; @Brocher1999; @VanWijk2001]. Late Cenozoic
volcanism of the region, in this scenario, is linked to the
youthfulness of the subducted microplate(s), implying an
“upside down” partial melting mechanism within and immediately adjacent
to the lithospheric lid. Both the slab window (or gap) and stalled
microplate hypotheses are based on plate kinematic relationships, which
upon closer analysis appears to require a combination of both slab
window and stalled oceanic microplate segments
[@Bohannon1995; @Atwater1998; @tenBrink1999; @Wilson2005].
Seismic data cited in support of the stalled slab hypothesis consist of
an 8-15 km thick low east-dipping mafic lower crustal layer that extends
beneath central California from the offshore region into proximity of
the San Andreas fault, and which thickens eastwards over Moho depths of
\~12-30 km [@Brocher1999]. Strong internal reflectivity within this layer
[@Trehu1987; @Brocher1999], and sharp
inflections in its upper surface [@Trehu1991] indicate that this mafic
layer is internally deformed and imbricated, which accounts for its
thickness exceeding typical oceanic mafic crust by a factor of two to
three.
<!-- Also see @Fuis1998, a review of Coast Range structure along the margin -->
Such imbrication and underplating require a basal detachment,
which most logically is the underlying Moho. In this context the
regions’s lower crustal mafic layer is more plausibly interpreted as a
regional underplated duplex of Farallon plate oceanic crustal nappes
that accreted during Franciscan subduction. The underlying mantle
lithosphere could be underplated Farallon plate mantle, and/or Monterey
microplate mantle with its crustal section left imbricated along the toe
of the mafic duplex in the offshore region. The Crystal Knob xenolith
suite is the only known direct sampling of this underplated mantle.

The pre-Neogene tectonic setting of the Crystal Knob eruption site is
shown in Figure 18 by restoration of the San Andreas dextral transform
system [@Matthews1976; @Dickinson2005; @Chapman2012; @Hall2013; @Sharman2013].
The Crystal Knob eruption site restores to a position outboard of the southern California
batholith. The principal windows into shallowly underplated subduction
channel schists are shown on Figure 18 along with the principal upper
plate batholithic exposures. The intervening areas left white denote
latest Cretaceous-Cenozoic overlap strata. On Figure 18 the current
western extent of the Salinia crystalline nappes is shown as the
Nacimiento fault and the offshore Farallon escarpment. Crystalline rocks
of the Salinia nappes extended westwards across Nacimiento belt
Franciscan an unknown distance [@Hall2013], but have been
eroded off their lower plate complex as the coastal region has risen in
the Pliocene [@Ducea2003].

The Figure 18 reconstruction exhibits the first-order crustal relations
that pose three highly plausible origins for the sub-Crystal Knob mantle
lithosphere: 1. shallowly ascended asthenosphere within the
Pacific-Farallon slab window [@Atwater1998]; 2. subduction
underplated, or stalled Monterey oceanic microplate [@Bohannon1995];
or 3. underplated Farallon plate mantle lithosphere nappe(s) that lie in structural sequence with the upper mantle duplex
resolved beneath the Dish Hill xenolith location [@Luffi2009].

## Slab windows and Monterey plate

Figure 18 shows the surface projection of the hypothetical slab window
and the partially subducted Monterey plate at ca. 19 Ma [@Wilson2005].
The slab window is thought to have formed by the subduction of the trailing edge of the Farallon plate, unsupported by sea floor
spreading along the former spreading axis with the Pacific plate. The
Monterey plate nucleated along an ~250 km long segment of the
Pacific-Farallon ridge as an oblique rift that was rotated ~25º clockwise
from the Pacific-Farallon rift axis [@Atwater1989].
It’s generation was synchronous with the early stages of
Pacific-Farallon plate convergence into the Cordilleran subduction zone
along the southern California coastal region, and coincided with
transrotational rifting of the continental borderland region and
displacement of the western Transverse Ranges bedrock
[@Bohannon1995; @Atwater1998]. The current position of the Monterey plate,
relative to the Crystal Knob eruption site, is a result
of dextral displacements linked to borderland transrotational rifting,
subsequent ~155 km-scale dextral offsets along the San Gregorio-Hosgri
fault system, and possible additional dextral offsets in the offshore
region (Fig. 3). A number of workers have suggested that translation of
the Monterey plate along the San Andreas system entailed significant
sub-horizontal fault segments that accommodated dextral displacements
[@Furlong1989; @Pikser2012]. As of yet, however, all
remotely imaged segments of the transform system have been shown to be
steeply oriented [@Dietz1990; @Brocher1999; @Yan2005; @Titus2007; @Yan2007; @Ozacar2009].
According to the Figure 18 reconstruction the Crystal Knob eruption site
was above the Pacific-Farallon slab window ~50-100 km north of the
northeast margin of the partially subducted Monterey plate. The narrow
slab window segment shown along the eastern edge of the partially
subducted plate marks the plate’s separation locus with the Farallon
plate, which subsequently opened wider beneath the southern California
region as the Farallon plate descended deeper into the mantle
[@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005]. Over the time interval of ca. 22-10 Ma the Monterey plate’s dextral motion relative to the subducting
trench had a nontrivial divergence component, as a result of it’s
coupling to the Pacific plate. The likelihood of extensional attenuation
of the underthrust portion of the Monterey plate during such divergent
motion is non-explored, but strongly implied in \citet[]['s]{Bohannon1995} reconstruction.
Coupling of Monterey plate divergent motion
across the subduction megathrust break is hypothesized to have driven
dextral transrotational rifting [@Bohannon1995]. As western
Transverse Range rock panels rotated into their current position from
transrotational rifting, the Monterey plate continued its northward
displacement along the San Gregorio-Hosgri fault system (Fig. 3). Note
that on Figure 18 the outer edge of the Farallon-Monterey slab window is
on trend with the San Gregorio-Hosgri fault system. Distinct steps and
inflections in lower crustal velocity structure across this fault system
[@Brocher1999] indicates that it cuts the entire crust. This
poses the likely possibility that the San Gregorio-Hosgri fault system
bounds the eastern margin of underplated Monterey plate in the coastal
central California region. This is in line with seismic observations
showing an ~16 E dip to the Monterey plate offshore, with a typical
abyssal crustal thickness, juxtaposed against a nearly flat thickened
lower crustal layer beneath the Nacimiento Franciscan  [@Trehu1991; @Nicholson1992].
These observations are in direct conflict with the notion that a structurally continuous mafic layer constitutes the
lower crust beneath the central coastal California and adjacent offshore
region, as dismissed in the discussions above.

The analysis presented above argues against models of the Monterey plate
having been translated horizontally as a “dangling slab” through the
upper mantle of the coastal region of southern to central California by
its coupling to Pacific plate motions [@VanWijk2001; @Pikser2012; @Wang2013].
This can be argued against on the basis of seismological, geodynamic and surface geological relations.
All such models rely on the untenable notion that a structurally continuous mafic
layer, representing stalled Monterey plate, constitutes the lower crust
beneath the entire coastal central California and offshore region (see
above). These studies further suggest that the Monterey “dangling slab”
currently corresponds to the high-wave speed anomaly of the southern
Sierra Nevada-Great Valley region (Fig. 1), commonly called the
“Isabella anomaly”. However, seismological and geodynamic studies much
more rigorously show that this anomaly represents the convectively
mobilized mantle wedge, or mantle lithosphere, derived from beneath the
eastern and southern Sierra Nevada batholith
[@Zandt2004; @Frassetto2011; @Gilbert2012; @Saleeby2012; @Jones2014; @Levandowski2015].
In addition to the structural continuity that these studies show between the seismic
anomaly and the residual mantle lithosphere that is still in place
beneath the Great Valley and Sierra Nevada (Fig. 3), these studies show
that the volume of the Isabella anomaly far exceeds a reasonable volume
estimate for the attenuated terminus of a hypothetical translated
Monterey slab. These studies also provide mechanisms for lower crustal
plastic deformation, observable surface faulting, upper mantle–lower
crustal partial melting and dynamic topographic effects that are ignored
in the dangling slab hypothesis. Surface geological effects of such
melting and topographic transients are closely correlated to the
convective mobilization of the sub-Sierran mantle lithosphere
[@Ducea1998b; @Farmer2002; @Saleeby2013; @Cecil2014; @Levandowski2015].
The surface effects of Monterey plate partial subduction followed by transtensional coupling to Pacific
plate motions are closely correlated to transrotational rifting in the
southern California Borderland and the linked clockwise rotation of
western Transverse Ranges bedrock panels [Fig. 3; @Bohannon1995; @Wilson2005].
This is in line with the Monterey slab’s limited down-dip extent as bounded by the Monterey-Farallon slab window
segment shown on Figure 18. If the hypothetical Monterey “dangling slab”
were of proper proportion to form the Isabella anomaly, then why were
its effects on surface geology restricted to the Borderland and
Transverse Ranges? Epeirogenic transients that correlate to the
convective mobilization of the sub-Sierran mantle lithosphere as the
Isabella anomaly are highly out of phase with the predicted translation
pattern for a “dangling” Monterey slab [@Saleeby2013; @Cecil2014].
Possible remnants of necked off partially subducted Monterey plate are more plausibly correlated to the Transverse Ranges high-wave
speed anomaly in terms of position and volume (Fig. 3), and also have a
firm geodynamic basis as such [@Burkett2009].

According to the @Wilson2005 reconstruction of the
Pacific-Farallon slab window and adjacent Monterey plate (Fig. 18), the
Crystal Knob eruption site was located above a slab window in the early
Neogene, proximal to the northeastern boundary transform edge of the
Monterey plate. Diffuse volcanism, some clearly derived from
decompression partial melting of convecting mantle, is widespread for
this time period across the region of the reconstructed slab window
[@Hurst1982; @Sharma1991; @Cole1995; @Wilson2005].
However, this phase of slab window opening and related volcanism
cannot account for the eruption of the ca. 1.7 Ma Crystal Knob volcanic
neck, which we return to below.

## Underplated Farallon Plate mantle nappes

The reconstruction of the Crystal Knob eruption site to its pre-San
Andreas position (Fig. 18) poses a highly viable alternative for the
development of the site’s underlying mantle lithosphere. This is
particularly viable in light of the neck having erupted through the
Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan complex, immediately adjacent to the
current outer limit of Salinia crystalline nappes (Fig. 1).  Accretion
of the Nacimiento belt occurred in the Late Cretaceous beneath the outer
reaches of the Salinia nappe sequence [@Hall2013; @Chapman2016a].
In their core area the Salinia nappes rode westwards on slightly older, higher metamorphic grade, Franciscan rocks that are
shown on Figures 1 and 18 as windows into subduction channel schists
[@Barth2003; @Kidder2006; @Ducea2009]. As
discussed earlier, the southernmost Sierra Nevada-western Mojave
“autochthon” for the Salinia nappes is likewise detached from its
original mantle wedge underpinnings, and shingled into crystalline
nappes that lie on underplated high-grade subduction channel schists as
well [@Saleeby2003; @Chapman2010; @Chapman2012; @Chapman2016b]. Tectonic
erosion of the mantle wedge followed by shallow subduction underplating
of Franciscan rocks requires subsequent reconstruction of the current
mantle lithosphere. As discussed above, @Luffi2009 present
findings on the Dish Hill and Cima mantle xenolith sites (Fig. 1) that
suggest the presence of a mantle lithosphere duplex with multiple
Farallon plate upper mantle nappes in structural sequence beneath a
residual roof of continental mantle lithosphere. In that the crustal
structural sequence of the western Mojave region correlates closely to
that of the Salinia nappes, spatially and temporally [@Chapman2010; @Chapman2012],
it stands to reason that upper mantle duplex accretion progressed
westwards from the Mojave region to beneath the Salinia
nappes as well as the Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan.

In Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections} we present a model for Farallon plate mantle lithosphere
having tectonically underplated the Mojave-Salinia-Nacimiento segment of
the SW Cordilleran convergent margin in the Late Cretaceous [after @Saleeby2003; @Luffi2009].
This is shown to have occurred in conjunction with shallow flat subduction of the Shatsky Rise conjugate
LIP [after @Saleeby2003; @Liu2010]. The approximate age of
Farallon plate entering the trench is shown on each frame [after @Seton2012].
Crustal deformation, timing and thermal conditions, as
applied to our thermal modeling presented below, are integrated from
@Kidder2006 and @Chapman2010; @Chapman2012; @Chapman2016a. Figure
17a and b show the arrival of the oceanic plateau into the subducting
trench, and plateau buoyancy driven shallowing of the subduction
megathrust, which drove tectonic erosion of the mantle wedge.
Temperature conditions along the flat subduction megathrust initiated at
\~900ºC, ambient conditions within the deep levels of the then-active
arc, and retrogressed to ~715ºC, peak temperatures recorded in shallowly
subducted metaclastic rocks of the Sierra de Salinas schist, exposed in
the principal Salinia window into the subduction channel schists [@Kidder2006].

In Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections}C and D we adopt the focused slab rollback and mantle
lithosphere underplating models of @Saleeby2003 and @Luffi2009,
for the dynamic response of normal thickness oceanic lithosphere
following the crustal thickened oceanic plateau down the subduction
zone. Principal crustal responses are shown as large magnitude
trench-directed extension coupled to regional extrusion of the
underplated subduction channel schists, which was driven by suction
forces of the retreating slab. In the Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections}c to d transition,
accelerated rollback is accomplished by duplex formation from Farallon
plate mantle nappes. We suspect that mantle nappe detachment was
controlled primarily by the temperature control on the brittle-plastic
transition in olivine. For ca. 40-50 m.y. old oceanic lithosphere
entering the subduction zone (Figures \ref{fig:cross_sections}c and d),
an estimated ~700-800 ºC
control on this transition [@Warren2006; @Burgmann2008; @Mei2010] occurs
at ~25-40 km depth in the slab [@Doin1996]. We also suspect that the retreat of the slab as it
subducted imparted a significant tensile stress component within the
slab that was oriented at high angle to the subduction megathrust, which
further promoted nappe detachment. The nucleation of detachment surfaces
was likely controlled by hydration fronts that followed primary normal
and transform faults within the upper oceanic lithosphere. The lack of
high-pressure mafic schist samples in both the Crystal Knob and Dish
Hill xenolith suites suggests that oceanic crust was detached during
mantle nappe detachment, presumably at oceanic Moho depths, to be
underplated as the seismically imaged thickened mafic lower crust of the
region [@Trehu1991; @Brocher1999]. On the basis of the regional
structural evolution of the central to southern California basement, and
on the petrogenetic history recorded in the region's mantle xenolith
suites, we consider the Figure \ref{fig:cross_sections}d section to be that most likely sampled by
the Crystal Knob eruption. This section is idealized for Late Cretaceous
time, and below we layer on the complexity of late Cenozoic faulting in
our analysis. We focus now to thermal history in order to more
thoroughly pursue the possible origins of the sub-Crystal Knob mantle
lithosphere.

## Thermal considerations

Regardless of the generalized lithospheric structure depicted in Figure
17, kinematic reconstructions of the impingement of the Pacific-Farallon
spreading center with the SW Cordilleran subducting trench require a
slab window beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site in the early Neogene
[@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005]. The depth of
asthenospheric underplating related to slab window opening is poorly
constrained, and likely to vary geographically as a function of
thickness and thermal variations in the pre-existing lithospheric lid,
as well its state of stress and structural coherency. Though volcanism
in the central California Coast Ranges has been tied to slab window
opening, its volume has not been consistent with volcanism associated other episodes of
shallow asthenospheric upwelling in the Cordillera particularly in the
forearc region of coastal central California [@Humphreys1995] <!-- not
familiar with this ref, please double check for its applicability-->.
This is readily explained if the slab window opened beneath a tiered
duplex of underplated Farallon mantle nappes, roofed by a duplex of
underplated Farallon oceanic crust (lower crustal mafic layer), in turn
roofed by the Nacimiento Franciscan and Salinia nappes. Our estimate of
a 50-80 km depth interval over which the Crystal Knob lavas sampled the
underlying mantle lithosphere (Fig. 14), coupled with a general lack of
significant late Cenozoic extensional faulting in the immediate region
implies a strong thermo-mechanical lid that likely suppressed the ascent
of voluminous asthenosphere derived magmas that were hypothetically
sourced from a deep underlying slab window.

## Geothermal implications

The Farallon Plate, Monterey Plate, and slab window scenarios for mantle
lithosphere emplacement all imply a peridotite composition with a
depleted (convecting-mantle) isotopic and trace-element signature.
Though petrographic and geochemical variations can provide information
on the fractionation history, they cannot discriminate between these
potential depleted convecting mantle sources. However, these emplacement
scenarios present potentially distinct thermal structures due to the
large differences in timescales of cooling.

The Farallon-- and Monterey--plate scenarios are qualitatively similar,
with initial emplacement beneath a mid-ocean ridge and cooling on the seafloor. After
subduction and underplating, the cooled oceanic lithosphere
re-equilibrates with an overlying 30 km of forearc crust until the
present, pr for our xenolith samples until the time of entrainment and
eruption. However, the timescales of cooling are significantly different. In
the Farallon-plate scenario, the maximum age of underplating is 70 Ma,
based on the youngest ages of the most pertinent (Sierra de Salinas and
correlative Sn Emigdio-Rand) schist bodies
[@Barth2003; @Grove2003; @Saleeby2007; @Chapman2010]. Seafloor being subducted at that time was 40 Myr old
[@Seton2012; @Liu2010]. This 110 Myr cooling history implies a relatively cold
modern geotherm. The potential Monterey Plate mantle lithosphere would have
been emplaced under the ridge at 27 Ma (corresponding to the chron 9
magnetic anomaly) and subducted shortly thereafter [@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005],
leaving a much shorter period for relaxation of the geotherm. The
emplacement of slab-window asthenosphere directly under the coastal
central California crust entails
the truncation of a low-temperature forearc geotherm at 19 Ma
[@Atwater1998] and the substitution of an asthenospheric adiabat below
this level. This scenario would provide the hottest modern geotherm,
which, according to @Erkan2008, is too hot to correspond to the
modern regional geotherm. <!-- (Daven, are they referring to the region
under CRTA, or the cooler Great Valley and Sierra Nevada) -->

<!--[[reconstruction]]-->

## Thermal modeling

<!-- (somewhere near the beginning of this section we need a very explicit
statement of what the heat flow data are, what the anomalies are, what
is CRTA, and how these data have been interpreted-remember, very few of
our readers will be familiar with these data, and potentially our most
critical reviewers will be very familiar with these data, and their
current interpretation. Here is a comment on Erkan and Blackwell that we
should incorporate into our qualitative analysis, I leave it to you to
fit it into this section in your logical progression, and wording: -->

They corner themselves into needing special circumstances to explain
CRTA like rapid recent uplift (which could be a contributing
factor @Ducea2003), shear heating or thermal
relaxation of stalled slab nonsense, just because they insist on the low
heat flow from the Great Valley-Sierra Nevada to be caused by a stalled
slab-classic circular reasoning. We need to go on the offensive here.
First thermal relaxation of a young stalled slab would not be much
different than a deep slab window. Low heat flow values under the entire
GV-SN are irrespective of where plate reconstructions show slab windows
or (Monterey) microplates, but map out very close to the distribution of
where Mesozoic mantle wedge/continental mantle lithosphere is still
intact beneath the crust. Compare E & B’s figure 1 map with the
structure contours that I added to Figure 3 for the Isabella anomaly as
well as the symbolism for the adjacent SE Sierra region that has lost
its mantle lithosphere. The structure contours show just the deeper part
of the anomaly, leaving lots of additional cool Mesozoic mantle
lithosphere beneath the Great valley to axial Sierra Nevada making the
correlation with E & B’s figure 1 pattern tighter. Then we can now layer
on what we know about lithosphere–scale heat production in the Sierra
Nevada from @Brady2006. I also email to you our “Epi II” paper on delamination which
has a helpful section on SN heat flow, right column, pg. 404). Bottom
line is that GV-SN heat flow, except where mantle lithosphere has
delaminated, reflects a relict Late Cretaceous geotherm developed during
extended flat slab subduction at the time or arc cessation. Crystal Knob
and Coyote Lake, in the Coast Ranges clearly show that there IS recent
upwelling under the Coast Ranges, not to mention the Clear Lake volcanic
field. E and B have about every aspect of their interpretation wrong,
but we should be careful and constructive in our criticism of their
work, for their data is very useful.

- Standard values for oceanic and continental material properties

<!-- (Not quite sure in what context you are referring to here) -->
    - may be significant over long timescales
    - will generally serve only to cool geotherms


Given the range of potential geothermal scenarios, models for the
emplacement of depleted mantle lithosphere under the central coastal
California region can
be tested by comparison of their implied geothermal structure with xenolith
geothermometry. However, this analysis is a crude approximation due to a lack of well-constrained geobarometers for spinel
peridotites.

<!--[[model_setups]]-->

## Model setup

Evaluation of potential thermal scenarios sampled by Crystal Knob require constraints on the implied present geotherm.
Forward-modeling of the initial thermal conditions will help assess the
level of separation between the scenarios after 25 Myr or more of
re-equilibration beneath the continental margin.
To distinguish between potential emplacement mechanisms for this mantle
lithosphere, a forward model of the geotherm implied by each case is
constructed.
A model based on the one-dimensional heat-flow equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{\rho C_p} \frac{\partial^2
T}{\partial z^2} + \frac{\alpha}{\rho C_p} \label{eqn:heat-flow}
\end{equation}
is used to track a vertical profile through the
lithosphere. This framework is used to follow the thermal state of the
xenolith source region from its most recent thermal peak, regardless
of tectonic setting, to its final emplacement beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site.

<!-- A temperature of 1300\degC is used to define the thickness of the
lithosphere (this probably doesn't matter because it is simply used to
set parameters for Royden model. Maybe should use mantle adiabat as in
Erkan2009 -->

### Oceanic geotherm

For the Neogene stalled Monterey plate and Late Cretaceous Farallon mantle nappe scenarios, the Global Depth and Heat (GDH)
model [@Stein1992] is used to trace the thermal evolution of the oceanic
lithosphere from its emplacement at the spreading ridge until subduction.
This model is an Taylor-polynomial fit of cooling parameters to global
heat-flow and depth datasets. This fit yields higher geotherms than half-space
cooling models that are directly based on Equation \eqn{heat-flow}
(e.g., @Fowler2005), and tends to produce higher geotherms for old
geothermal lithosphere.
All models, including GDH and half-space cooling models, significantly
overestimate heat flux from young oceanic plates, a fact that is likely attributable
to vigorous hydrothermal circulation in young submarine lithosphere [@Stein1992;@Stein1995].
This may result in overestimates of geothermal gradients for the youngest
subduction scenarios.

<!-- Could potentially use a more nuanced model, e.g., GDH, or run
finite-difference ourselves -->

For simplicity, oceanic crust is not considered
separately within the model framework.

Increasing the thermal conductivity of the model domain substantially
flattens the modeled geotherms.

<!--[[model_tracers]]-->

### Supra-subduction geotherm

The geotherm of the forearc wedge during subduction is calculated using
the @Royden1993a analytical solution for the steady-state thermal
structure of continuously-subducting systems.  <!-- At this rate it takes 5 Myr after
subduction to reach the final position! This is pretty significant, it
seems..., maybe should be incorporated! Also, depth of subduction
interface may be greater, especially in Monterey-plate (i.e. probably
not flat-slab case). --> Shear heating on the subduction thrust is taken
to be 15 mW/m^2. Rates of surface erosion in the forearc and
subduction accretion are taken to be 0. <!-- Accretion rates of 0.2-3.6
km/Myr favored by Kidder,2013 based on Sierra de Pelona schist. -->

The coastal California accretionary crust is represented homogenously as a material with a
thermal conductivity of 2.5 W/m/K, specific heat capacity of
1000 J/kg/K, density of 2800 kg/m^3 and a radiogenic heat
flux of 1 uW/m^3, values that are close to average for the
continental crust [@Fowler2005] and those used by @Kidder2013 to model
the thermal conditions along the Late Cretaceous shallow subduction
megathrust segment.
<!-- Check Kidder2013 and Brady2006 -->

### Underplating

To simulate subduction and underplating, the forearc geotherm
is stacked atop the modeled oceanic geotherm and relaxed towards
the present by iteratively
solving the heat-flow equation using finite differences. The entire
model is implemented in Python, with finite-difference modeling based on
the FiPy software package [@Guyer2009]. Explicit and implicit finite
difference approaches are combined using a two-sweep Crank-Nicholson
technique [@Crank1947] to ensure a stable result.

Progressive subduction of the downgoing slab beneath the
forearc wedge is modeled as stepwise advection beneath a linearly thickening
forearc wedge conforming to the @Royden1993a thermal model using
the parameters outlined above.
For all cases, the final depth of the underplated subduction interface
is taken to be 30 km, and the distance landward of the subduction zone
is taken to be 100 km.
No effort is made to differentiate 'flat-slab' and baseline subduction
geometries. Though increasing the slab dip angle will result in a cooler subduction interface at a given depth, the
overall effect on the evolution of the thermal
scenarios appears to be minimal. <!-- is this enough? -->

In the Farallon-plate scenario, the temperature is pegged at 715ºC at
25 km depth, a temperature constraint that is established based garnet-biotite
thermometry of exhumed granites of the Sierra de Salinas.
Figure \ref{model_results}C panel 2 correctly captures the inverted metamorphic
gradient found by @Kidder2006, validating this approach to calculating the
forearc geotherm.

<!--[[cross_sections]]-->

<!--[[neogene_sections]]-->

### Limitations of the model

This model framework has several simplifications.
Surface erosion after underplating is taken to be zero. The majority of
erosion to the mid-crustal levels now at the surface in Salinia is
likely to have occurred in a major pulse of unroofing coincident with
flat-slab underplating and rollback [@Chapman2012].
<!-- Would it be helpful to explore the parameter space
fully using Monte Carlo methods
similar to those used by Kidder, 2013? -->
Also, the underplating scenario is modeled incompletely --
when the trench interface jumps with the emplacement of an oceanic mantle
nappe beneath the forearc, the new subduction interface will cool the
detached nappe from below. This is not modeled because it would
substantially increase model complexity (requiring a fully
iterative approach to the forearc geotherm), and at this
distance (~100 km) inboard of the final trench interface, there is
limited scope for further rollback after emplacement of the nappe of interest.

The potential for disequilibrium processes such
as slab window heating to disrupt the geotherm at depth during the long
residence time beneath the crust are not considered in the model. <!--
(This is confusing, I thought that was one of our scenarios. This needs
to be clarified) -->
There are no reliable estimates of the mantle heat flux that cover the model
domain, and the thermal environment for underplated mantle lithosphere is complicated
by the presence of a subducting slab below the model domain at some depth. The model
is run to great depth to avoid any influence on the surface geotherm. However,
Farallon and forearc scenarios can be treated as maximum temperatures because of
the influence of the overriding slab. <!-- (not sure what you are
talking about here. What is “forearc scenarios”) -->

<!--[[model_results]]-->


### Model results

Model results are presented in \figref{model_results} and
\figref{model_comparison}.
For the Farallon-plate scenarios, <!-- why plural -->the @Royden1993a forearc model
predicts low temperatures (~235-245 ºC) at the subduction
interface. This is quite low relative to the temperatures predicted for
the Sierra Pelona schist (~700 ºC) by @Kidder2013, or
700-800 ºC derived as an emplacement constraint for the Sierra de
Salinas schist [@Kidder2006]. In the stalled
Monterey-plate scenario, temperature is predicted to be
980 ºC at the subduction interface. Despite this uncertainty in subduction conditions, the
model is much more sensitive to the thermal history of the oceanic plate
than to the forearc geotherm. For all longer run-time models (both the
forearc <!-- ??? --> and Farallon scenarios), this may prove to be a major factor.

The baseline scenario with late Cretaceous rollback and temperatures
pinned to the Sierra de Salinas schist has a very similar final thermal
structure to the older stalled slab scenarios <!-- do we show these in
the model? -->, showing that the
high subduction-channel temperatures experienced during late-Cretaceous flat slab
subduction and schist metamorphism do not have a long-lasting impact on the
thermal structure of the margin. Thus, these cannot be
explain the elevated temperatures experienced by the Crystal Knob
peridotites.

The model predicts much higher temperatures <!-- (do you mean to say a
much higher thermal gradient, or surface heat flow, or both, or if not
much higher temperatures where, and relative to what?) --> for the slab window than
for the Farallon-plate or stalled-slab models, which corresponds to
previous studies @Erkan2008. However, these studies concluded that the
effect must be due to a stalled slab, where in fact underplated Farallon mantle nappes satisfy the surface heat flow data equally well.


It is possible that the slab could be older.
But, thermal relaxation of an old slab would not contribute any heat to explain
elevated heat flow values in Coast Ranges (CRTA).
<!-- What is CRTA? Maybe you should email me Erkan and Blackwell. Are
these, or is this, several points, or a single point of high heat flow
measurements within the regional field of low heat flow measurements. If
so where are these point(s). They could be important in terms of deep
heat advection, in terms of why a 1.7 Ma lava would erupt in the region)
-->

@Erkan2008 pointed out that heat flow for the stalled slab scenario was too low to
fully explain anomalous heat flows in the Coast ranges.
Model-predicted heat flows lower than measured values could be explained
by added heat flux from shear heating [@Thatcher1998] or erosion [@Mancktelow1997;@England1990]

<!--[[model_comparison]]-->

Estimating erosion is beyond the scope of this study, but pulses of recent erosion
in the Coast Ranges are <!-- see Ducea et al. (2003) for rapid late
Cenozoic uplift of the Santa Lucia’s -->


## Contemporary lithospheric structure and thermal state

In this section we integrate the results of our thermal modeling with
our petrogenetic findings on the Crystal Knob xenoliths, regional
crustal structure and evolution, and the timing and map position of
xenolith entrainment. Of the three plausible scenarios depicted for the
evolution of the sub-Crystal Knob mantle lithosphere on Figure 16 we
reject the shallow slab window emplaced asthenosphere case based on our
thermal modeling presented above. The Monterey plate stalled slab and
underplated Farallon plate mantle nappe cases are equally plausible
based on our thermal modeling. Based on a wide spectrum of geologic and
geodynamic factors, that were discussed above, we dismiss the notion of
a regionally extensive Monterey Plate “dangling slab” extending far to
the east of the San Andreas fault as suggested by @Pikser2012.
Depending on the original scale of Monterey Plate underthrusting beneath
the southern California borderland region (Fig. 18), its structural
integrity following its coupling to borderland transrotational rifting,
and on what proportion of the partially subducted plate is now
represented by the detached portion that forms the Transverse Ranges
high-wave speed anomaly \figref{context}, an argument could be made that an
underthrust portion of the Monterey Plate has been translated northwards
horizontally beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site
(Figure \ref{neogene_sections}b). Although
kinematically plausible, in theory, this case seems unlikely based on
dynamic factors. As with the “dangling slab” version of this case,
horizontal translation of such a large mantle mass along the base of the
crust should manifest at surface levels by transients in dynamic
topography, as well brittle crustal deformational responses to
horizontal shear stresses in the lower crust. Such surface deformation
patterns are not expressed for late Cenozoic time north of the
Transverse Ranges though. Furthermore, such horizontal translation of a
previously underthrust slab offers little in terms of melting mechanisms
neither for Neogene nor Pleistocene volcanic centers of the region. We
thus conclude that despite of our findings on the Crystal Knob xenolith
suite not being able to discriminate between the stalled Monterey plate,
or underplated Farallon nappe cases, the stalled Monterey plate case
creates more problems than it solves.

On Figure 16c we show the partially subducted terminus of the Monterey
plate bounded to the east by the San Gregorio-Hosgri fault, based on our
above discussion of the Figure 18 reconstruction. East of the fault lies
the Nacimiento Franciscan complex and its tectonic veneer of Salinia
nappes (not differentiated on the figure), and its lower crustal oceanic
crustal duplex tectonically above underplated Farallon plate mantle
nappes. The structural profile shown on Figure 16c between the San
Andreas and San Gregorio-Hosgri faults was constructed at southern
California latitudes in continuity with that of the southernmost Sierra
Nevada and adjacent Mojave plateau region (Figs. 17 and 18). Partial
subduction, or stalling, of the Monterey plate occurred along the outer
edge of Franciscan complex further south than rocks of the Nacimiento
belt (Fig. 18).

Slab window opening beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site is
reconstructed to have occurred between ca. 28-23 Ma [@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005].
As posited above, the thick and relatively
cool lithospheric lid that the slab window of this region opened beneath
inhibited widespread voluminous volcanism in response to asthenospheric
upwelling. The time lag between deep slab window opening and the ca. 1.7
Ma eruption age of Crystal Knob presents a problem for the origin of the
Crystal Knob lava. Our studies on the Crystal Knob xenoliths indicate an
underlying lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at a depth of 50-80 km,
which is consistent with regional seismic studies placing it at ~70 km
beneath the central California Coast Ranges [@Li2007]. In
contrast 28-20 Ma old oceanic lithosphere of the adjacent Monterey plate
[@Wilson2005], based on thermal decay relations [@Doin1996],
would have its lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at ~35 km.
The offshore Monterey plate is at the edge of \citet[]['s]{Li2007}
resolution, which yields an ~50 km depth for the
lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.  Proximal to the modern shoreline
the Monterey plate is thrust beneath ~12 km of sedimentary accretionary
prism [@Trehu1991], bringing the thermal maturation theoretical depth
for the transition much closer to the depth observed by @Li2007.
Crystal Knob is located ~15 km east of the Hosgri fault, with it’s host
Franciscan complex pervasively cut by faults and shear zones
[@Cowan1978; @Seiders1989]. The geologic slip and seismicity history of the
Hosgri fault [@Dickinson2005; @Hardebeck2012] indicate that it
was likely active during the eruption of the Crystal Knob neck.
Integration of theoretical and observational data on intra-continental
transform faults [@Platt2011; @Titus2007] indicate
that at lower crustal--upper mantle levels Hosgri fault shear could be
distributed across 10s of kilometers normal to the fault surface [Figure \ref{neogene_sections}].
Eruption of small-volume basaltic flows of Plio-Pleistocene age,
some with lower crust and upper mantle xenoliths also occurred ~150 km
north of Crystal Knob along the San Andreas-Calaveras fault bifurcation
zone [@Jove1998; @Titus2007]. Xenoliths recovered
from these flows record asthenosphere ascent and partial melting that
markedly post-dates any possible slab window opening, and thus the
Crystal Knob small volume eruption is not an exceptional event.

Distributed shearing and strike-slip juxtaposition of the shallow
sub-Monterey plate asthenosphere against underplated Farallon plate
lithosphere and its deep slab window asthenosphere along the Hosgri
fault (Fig. 16c) is a plausible mechanism for Crystal Knob basalt melt
generation. This was perhaps accentuated by possible extensional
transients along the fault surface as documented for the Coyote Lake
basalts [@Jove1998; @Titus2007]. Thermal modeling
presented above indicates that underplated Farallon mantle was already
re-heated by the deeper Neogene slab window. The dominance of dunite
cumulate xenoliths that appear to be related to the Crystal Knob lava,
and that volumetrically far exceed the lithospheric peridotite
xenoliths, attest to at least another reheating event at ca. 1.7 Ma. Two
of the principal thermal maxima in the Coast Range thermal anomaly occur
in the areas of the Crystal Knob and Coyote Lake Plio-Pleistocene
basaltic eruptions [@Erkan2008, Fig. 1], further
suggesting recent mobilization of asthenospheric mantle that was
initially emplaced into the early Neogene slab window. 


Conclusion
==========

- Slab window is really hot!
- Farallon plate and older forearc are really cold
    - Converging on “steady-state” value
- Farallon heated from below seems to work well
    - Provides a thermal buffer for low-heatflow coast range and can
      potentially help explain the Coast Range Thermal Anomaly

Thermal relaxation of a young stalled slab is largely similar to
a deep slab window, thermally buffered by old lithosphere.

An initial petrologic study of the Crystal Knob peridotite xenoliths has
been conducted, and thermobarometry has been applied to examine the
thermal state of their mantle source. These xenoliths sample the
lithosphere at moderate to deep (45-80 km) depths and are divided into
two groups which record subtly different temperatures. Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr
isotopes show that the samples are derived from the depleted convecting
mantle. <!-- Given the location of the Salinian block adjacent to the Mojave
prior to \SI{5}{Ma},--> Given this, the samples are derived from
some generation of the Farallon downgoing slab. However, the thermal models
approach equilibrium at long timescales, and depth constraints are
imperfect at best, so distinguishing between the plateau-emplacement and
older underplating scenarios is difficult at best. No compelling features
to distinguish these two scenarios are as yet identifiable.

Continuing refinement of thermometry and depth constraints
along with forward-modeling of temperature scenarios will potentially
improve the ability to resolve the structure of the geotherm, but the
uncertainties inherent in spinel peridotite barometry may prove
crippling. Regardless, the completed work and continuing petrologic
analysis of the host basalt and cumulates will lead to an improved
understanding of the coastal California mantle lithosphere.
