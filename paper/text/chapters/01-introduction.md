Introduction
============

The tectonic and petrogenetic processes by which Earth’s continental mantle
lithosphere develops through time are of fundamental importance to geodynamics
and Earth history. The architecture of the mantle lithosphere, when integrated
with regional geophysical data and tectonic and petrogenetic studies of the
overlying crust, offers critical insights into the geodynamic processes of
continental assembly. Mantle xenoliths entrained in volcanic rock reveal
compositions and textures of the deep lithosphere in a vertical transect below
the eruptive event, and petrogenetic studies of xenolith suites can discern
their thermal conditions, depth of entrainment, and geochemical evolution. In
this contribution, we present new petrologic and geochemical data on mantle
xenoliths hosted in the Pleistocene Crystal Knob volcanic neck in coastal
central California. We integrate these findings both with regional
geophysical and modeling studies of the mantle lithosphere and a well-developed
literature on the tectonic and petrogenetic development of the overlying
crust.

The Crystal Knob xenolith locality samples a crucially important lithospheric
column through the Late Cretaceous convergent margin of the North American
Cordillera. This regionally extensive belt includes a voluminous
continental magmatic arc, generated as the Farallon oceanic plate
subducted eastward beneath western North America [e.g. @Glazner1991;
@Ducea2015], and the Franciscan complex, the crustal-level accretionary complex
of this subduction zone. The Franciscan includes tectonic slivers of Farallon
plate oceanic basement and pelagic sediment, as well as upper plate
siliciclastic sediments derived from the magmatic arc [@Cowan1978;
@Murchey1984; @Sliter1984; @Blake1988; @Chapman2016; @Chapman2016a]. The
crystalline basement blocks of the "Salinian terrane", or "Salinia"
[@Page1981], have recently been recognized as a series of nappes derived from
the southern California segment of the Late Cretaceous magmatic arc, displaced
westward to lie tectonically above the accretionary complex near the central
California coast [@Hall1991; @Barth2003; @Kidder2006; @Ducea2009; @Chapman2012;
@Hall2013]. The Crystal Knob xenolith locality lies along the western margin of
Salinia, adjacent to the Nacimiento fault [@fig:context], a polyphase shear
zone which, in its original geometry, constituted the local structural base of
the Salinian crystalline nappe sequence [@Hall2013]. In this setting, the
Crystal Knob xenolith suite samples the uppermost mantle that has been
constructed beneath both the Franciscan accretionary complex and its local
veneer of Salinia crystalline nappes.

## Regional tectonic setting and previous mantle xenolith studies

The southwest North American Cordillera hosts many xenolith localities, at
which upper mantle and lower crustal rock fragments were entrained in mainly
late Cenozoic volcanic eruptions. Early studies of a number of these xenolith
suites focused on the systematizing of petrographic features and classifying
samples into textural groups [e.g. @Nixon1987; @Wilshire1988]. Subsequently,
modern geochemical and petrogenetic techniques have revealed several regional
mantle lithosphere domains: Precambrian crustal root, Cretaceous arc mantle
wedge, underplated Farallon plate nappes, and late Cenozoic shallow convective
asthenosphere [e.g. @Galer1989; @Livaccari1993; @Alibert1994; @Beard1995;
@Ducea1998a; @Jove1998; @Lee2001; @Usui2003; @Luffi2009].

These studies suggest a clear correspondence between xenolith-sampled upper
mantle domains and surface geology. Sub-continental suites are generally
erupted through cratonic and peri-cratonic crust, mantle wedge suites through
the Cretaceous large-volume batholith, and asthenospheric suites through active
rifts. Xenolith suites derived from underplated Farallon plate mantle nappes
have thus far only been recovered from more inboard crustal domains, requiring
large sub-horizontal displacements and underplating along relatively shallow
subduction megathrust systems [@Helmstaedt1975; @Lee2001b]. Crystal Knob
presents a rare opportunity to sample mantle lithosphere directly beneath the
region of long-lived subduction accretion proximal to the plate edge.

The tectonic setting of the sub-Crystal Knob mantle lithosphere is best understood
by restoring its host crustal rocks to their position prior to San Andreas
transform offset. This places them outboard of the southern California batholith,
the southern continuation of the Sierra Nevada
batholith across the Garlock fault [@fig:context].
In this restored position, the crystalline nappes that constitute Salinia
correlate to deeply exhumed Cretaceous arc plutonic rocks of the southernmost
Sierra Nevada batholith and the northwestern zones of the southern California
batholith, the latter widely exposed in the Mojave plateau [@Wood1997;
@Saleeby2003; @Barbeau2005; @Chapman2012]. These deeply exhumed batholithic
rocks share a common regional upper plate position above a polyphase low-angle
fault system below which Franciscan-affinity, mainly metaclastic rocks were
tectonically underplated in the Late Cretaceous [@Malin1995; @Barth2003;
@Yan2005; @Ducea2009; @Chapman2010; @Chapman2012; @Chapman2016b]. These
subduction channel schists are exposed in a series of tectonic windows
[@fig:context] and tectonically encase blocks and nappes of Farallon-plate
oceanic basement and sediments. The schist protoliths were derived from the
upper plate batholithic belt, which was rapidly exhumed above a shallow flat
segment of the Franciscan subduction megathrust system [@Barth2003;
@Saleeby2007; @Chapman2013; @Chapman2016a]. This "flat slab" is attributed to
the ephemeral buoyancy resulting from the subduction of the conjugate massif to
the Shatsky Rise oceanic igneous province [@Livaccari1981; @Sliter1984;
@Saleeby2003], which is currently resolved in deep seismic tomographic images
beneath the interior of North America [@Liu2010; @Sun2017]. The Salinia nappes
and adjacent (restored for Neogene dextral faulting) deeply exhumed batholithic
rocks were displaced and structurally attenuated by both the shallow subduction
megathrust and subsequent trench-directed extensional faulting, which occurred
as the Shatsky conjugate moved deeper into the mantle beneath the North
American plate [@Saleeby2003; @Liu2010; @Chapman2012].

Shallow tectonic underplating of the subduction-channel schists
directly beneath deep crustal large-volume batholithic rocks requires the prior
tectonic erosion of the mantle wedge lithosphere (the
source for the overlying batholith) and parts of the deepest arc crust.
Integrated mantle xenolith studies and deep seismic imaging document this process.
Late Miocene small-volume
volcanic flows and plugs from the central Sierra Nevada batholith [@fig:context]
carry xenolith suites that sampled the Cretaceous mantle wedge of the overlying
batholith [@Ducea1996; @Ducea1998a; @Lee2001; @Saleeby2003; @Lee2006;
@Chin2015]. The central and northern regions of the batholith are currently
exposed over shallow to medial crustal depths (2 to 4 kb pressure), whereas at
its southern reaches, a continuous gradient to deep levels (10 kb) is exposed
[@Ague1988a; @Nadin2008]. At this depth, the shallow subduction megathrust
(remobilized as an extensional structure) forms the structural base of the
batholith, with the underplated schists lying directly beneath [@Saleeby2003;
@Chapman2010; @Chapman2012; @Chapman2016b]. Seismic reflection imaging shows
an effectively flat megathrust beneath the western Mojave plateau [@Yan2005]
and dips of ~30ºN beneath the southernmost Sierra Nevada region [@Malin1995].
The Garlock fault [@fig:context] nucleated during the early Miocene along this
inflection in the megathrust [@Saleeby2016], which constituted a lateral ramp
in the subduction megathrust system [@Saleeby2003; @Chapman2016b].

In contrast to the central Sierra xenolith suite, mantle xenoliths recovered
from the eastern margin of the southern California batholith record the partial
tectonic erosion of sub-continental mantle lithosphere (including Cretaceous
mantle wedge), and the underplating of Farallon plate mantle lithosphere
[@Shervais1973; @Luffi2009; @Armytage2015; @Shields2016GSA]. More specifically,
the Dish Hill suite [@fig:context] samples an upper mantle duplex with
imbricated nappes of Farallon plate oceanic mantle lying in structural
sequence beneath a relatively thin roof of attenuated continental lithosphere
peridotites. The mantle duplex is interpreted to have formed as the Farallon
plate retreated following Shatsky conjugate low-angle subduction [@Luffi2009].
The reconstructed position of Crystal Knob, directly outboard of the Dish
Hill locality [@fig:context], as well as its penetration of the Franciscan
accretionary complex, suggests that the Crystal Knob suite may have sampled
additional underplated Farallon mantle nappes outboard of the Dish Hill mantle
duplex.

Mantle xenoliths of the eastern Sierra suite [@fig:context], viewed in the context of late
Cenozoic plate kinematics of the southern California region [@Argus1991; @Atwater1998]
suggest another potential origin for the sub-Crystal Knob upper mantle. The eastern Sierra suite occurs in
Pliocene-Quaternary mafic lava flows and records a significantly steeper
thermal gradient and more fertile compositions
than the Cretaceous mantle wedge suite from the central Sierra
[@Ducea1996; @Ducea1998b]. Seismic data from the eastern Sierra region
reveal asthenospheric mantle extending upwards to the base of the crust at ~30 km
depth [@Jones1998; @Zandt2004; @Frassetto2011; @Jones2014], consistent with the
eastern Sierra xenolith suite findings. The eruption of xenolith-hosting lavas
within the eastern Sierra suite within the <5 Ma Owens Valley rift system
[@fig:context] was presumably driven by upper mantle convection
[@LePourhiet2006; @Jones2015]. Convective ascent of asthenosphere to relatively
shallow levels and late Cenozoic regional volcanism of the central to southern
California region [@Dodge1988] are correlated with the opening of the
Pacific-Farallon slab window [@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005].  Both the eruption of
Crystal Knob and the origin of its upper mantle underpinnings could also owe
their origins to asthenosphere ascended into a slab window.

Below we investigate the petrology and
geochemistry of the Crystal Knob suite and link it to
regional findings on other xenolith locations, as well as geophysical data and
modeling, in order to pursue the origin of the upper mantle beneath the Crystal
Knob eruption site and the central California Coast Ranges more
generally.
