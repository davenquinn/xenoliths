Introduction
============

The tectonic and petrogenetic processes by which Earth’s continental mantle
lithosphere develops through time are of fundamental importance to geodynamics
and Earth history. The architecture of the mantle lithosphere, when integrated
with regional geophysical data and tectonic and petrogenetic studies of the
overlying crust, offers critical insights into the geodynamic processes of
continental assembly. Mantle xenoliths entrained in volcanic rock reveal
compositions and textures in a vertical transect through the underlying deep
lithosphere. Petrogenetic studies of xenolith suites can discern their thermal
conditions, depth of entrainment, and geochemical evolution. These features
can provide insight into tectonic processes affecting the entire lithosphere.

The Crystal Knob xenolith suite, in the Coast Ranges of central California,
presents a rare opportunity to sample the mantle lithosphere directly beneath
a region of long-lived subduction accretion. The complex Late Cretaceous and
Neogene tectonic processes that built the present Coast Ranges suggest several
possible scenarios for the origin of the underlying  mantle lithosphere. When
restored for Neogene dextral offset, the position of of Crystal Knob suggests
that its upper mantle underpinnings may have originated as asthenospheric
mantle upwelling into the Pacific-Farallon slab window [@Wilson2005]. Other
workers [e.g. @Pikser2012] propose a shallowly-dipping stalled slab beneath the
Coast Ranges from the latest phase of subduction in the Neogene. We propose
a third model, in which mantle lithosphere was underplated during Given its
position near the edge of the continent, this pre-existing lithospheric mantle
would have experienced a thermal pulse due to ridge subduction in the Neogene
[@Wilson2005].

In this contribution, we present new petrologic, geochemical, and
thermobarometric data on mantle xenoliths hosted in the Pleistocene Crystal
Knob volcanic neck in coastal central California. These new datasets, plus
derivative geochemical modeling and thermal modeling of the central California
lithosphere, are used to decipher the petrogenesis of Crystal Knob xenoliths
and host basaltic lavas. Constraints on the thermal structure of the mantle
lithosphere are used to test the three models of the Late Cretaceous to present
evolution of the lithospheric underpinnings of central California. The tectonic
processes uncovered by this study can provide new insights into
the relative role of Cretaceous and Neogene processes in building the margin of
the North American continent.

## Regional tectonic setting

The Crystal Knob xenolith locality samples an important
lithospheric column through the Late Cretaceous convergent margin of the
North American Cordillera. This regionally extensive belt includes a
voluminous continental magmatic arc, generated as the Farallon oceanic
plate subducted eastward beneath western North America [e.g.
@Glazner1991; @Ducea2015], and the Franciscan complex, the crustal-level
accretionary complex of this subduction zone. The Franciscan includes
tectonic slivers of Farallon plate oceanic basement and pelagic
sediment, as well as upper plate siliciclastic sediments derived from
the magmatic arc [@Cowan1978; @Murchey1984; @Sliter1984; @Blake1988;
@Chapman2016; @Chapman2016a]. The crystalline basement blocks of the
"Salinian terrane", or "Salinia" [@Page1981], have recently been
recognized as a series of nappes derived from the southern California
segment of the Late Cretaceous magmatic arc, displaced westward to lie
tectonically above the accretionary complex near the central California
coast [@Hall1991; @Barth2003; @Kidder2006; @Ducea2009; @Chapman2012;
@Hall2013]. The Crystal Knob xenolith locality lies along the western
margin of Salinia, adjacent to the Nacimiento fault [@fig:context], a
polyphase shear zone which, in its original geometry, constituted the
local structural base of the Salinian crystalline nappe sequence
[@Hall2013]. The Crystal Knob xenolith suite
samples the uppermost mantle beneath the Franciscan accretionary complex and its local veneer of
Salinia crystalline nappes.

Restoring the central Coast Ranges to their
position prior to San Andreas transform offset places them outboard of the
southern California batholith, the southern continuation of the Sierra
Nevada batholith, extended remnants of which are widely exposed
south of the Garlock fault in
the Mojave Desert [@fig:context]. In this
restored position, the crystalline nappes that constitute Salinia
correlate to deeply exhumed Cretaceous arc plutonic rocks of the
southernmost Sierra Nevada batholith and northwestern
southern California batholith [@Wood1997; @Saleeby2003; @Barbeau2005;
@Chapman2012]. 

The southernmost Sierra Nevada batholith is exhumed, with granitic rocks
at the surface originating at shallow to medial crustal depths (2 to 4
kb pressure) in the bulk of the batholith grading towards deep crustal
levels (10 kb) at its southernmost reaches [@Ague1988a; @Nadin2008].
Seismic imaging shows a strong reflector which is effectively flat
beneath the western Mojave plateau [@Yan2005] and dips ~30ºN beneath the
southernmost Sierra Nevada [@Malin1995]. This inflection aligns with
increasing exhumation of the batholith and is interpreted as the relict
megathrust surface, with a lateral ramp towards a "flat slab" beneath
the Mojave province, atop which the southern California batholith was
dispersed and truncated [@Saleeby2003; @Chapman2016b]. The Garlock fault
[@fig:context] nucleated along this inflection during the early Miocene
[@Saleeby2016].

These exhumed batholithic rocks form the upper plate above a polyphase
low-angle extensional fault system, remobilized
along the former shallow subduction megathrust in the late Cretaceous. Franciscan-affinity,
mainly metaclastic rocks were
underplated beneath this tectonic surface [@Malin1995;
@Barth2003; @Saleeby2003; @Yan2005; @Ducea2009; @Chapman2010; @Chapman2012;
@Chapman2016b]. These subduction channel schists are exposed in a series of
tectonic windows [@fig:context] and encase blocks and nappes of
Farallon-plate oceanic basement and sediments. The schist protoliths were
derived from the upper plate batholithic belt, which was rapidly exhumed above
a shallow flat segment of the Franciscan subduction megathrust system
[@Barth2003; @Saleeby2007; @Chapman2013; @Chapman2016a].
The truncation of lower-crustal batholithic rocks and underplating of
subduction-channel schists requires the tectonic erosion of the underlying
mantle wedge lithosphere and deepest arc crust.

The southern California "flat slab" is attributed to the ephemeral buoyancy
resulting from the subduction of the conjugate massif to the Shatsky Rise
oceanic igneous province [@Livaccari1981; @Sliter1984; @Saleeby2003], which is
currently resolved in deep seismic tomographic images beneath the interior of
North America [@Liu2010; @Sun2017]. The Salinia nappes and adjacent (restored
for Neogene dextral faulting) deeply exhumed batholithic rocks were displaced
and structurally attenuated by both the shallow subduction megathrust and
subsequent trench-directed extensional faulting, which occurred as the Shatsky
conjugate moved deeper into the mantle beneath the North American plate
[@Saleeby2003; @Liu2010; @Chapman2012].

In the Neogene, ridge subduction and the opening of the Pacific-Farallon
slab window [@Atwater1998] drove far-field effects including late
Cenozoic regional volcanism in central and southern California
[@Dodge1988] and the convective ascent of asthenosphere in the southern
Basin and Range province [@LePourhiet2006]. Beginning in the Miocene,
the crustal blocks through which Crystal Knob erupted were moved
northwest along the San Andreas transform system to their present
position [e.g. @Argus1991; @Wilson2005].

## Previous mantle xenolith studies

The southwest North American Cordillera hosts many xenolith localities, at
which upper mantle and lower crustal rock fragments were entrained in mainly
late Cenozoic volcanic eruptions. Early studies of a number of these xenolith
suites catalogued petrographic features and classified samples into textural
groups [e.g. @Nixon1987; @Wilshire1988]. Subsequently, modern geochemical and
petrogenetic techniques have revealed several regional mantle lithosphere
domains: Precambrian crustal root, Cretaceous arc mantle wedge, underplated
Farallon plate nappes, and late Cenozoic shallow convective asthenosphere [e.g.
@Galer1989; @Livaccari1993; @Alibert1994; @Beard1995; @Ducea1998a; @Jove1998;
@Lee2001; @Usui2003; @Luffi2009].

The central Sierra Nevada xenolith suite [@fig:context] was entrained in late
Miocene small-volume volcanic flows and plugs north of the zone of "flat slab"
subduction. It samples the intact Sierra Nevada batholithic root and
Cretaceous mantle wedge [@Ducea1996; @Ducea1998a; @Lee2001;
@Saleeby2003; @Lee2006; @Chin2015]. In contrast, xenoliths suites in the
eastern Mojave province record the partial tectonic erosion of sub-continental
mantle lithosphere (including Cretaceous mantle wedge) and underplating of
Farallon-plate mantle lithosphere [@Shervais1973; @Luffi2009; @Armytage2015;
@Shields2016GSA]. The Dish Hill locality [@fig:context] records an upper mantle
duplex with imbricated nappes of Farallon-plate oceanic mantle lying
structurally beneath a relatively thin roof of attenuated
continental-lithosphere peridotite. The mantle duplex is interpreted to have
formed as the Farallon plate retreated following low-angle subduction of the
Shatsky conjugate [@Luffi2009].

Xenoliths of the eastern Sierra suite [@fig:context] occur in
Pliocene-Quaternary mafic lava flows and record significantly steeper thermal
gradients and more fertile compositions than the older xenoliths of the central
Sierra, suggesting Neogene asthenospheric upwelling [@Ducea1996; @Ducea1998b].
Seismic studies show a corresponding domain of asthenospheric mantle that
extends to the base of the crust (~30 km depth) in the eastern Sierra
[@Jones1998; @Zandt2004; @Frassetto2011; @Jones2014]. The eruption of
xenolith-hosting lavas of the eastern Sierra suite within the <5 Ma Owens Valley
rift system [@fig:context] was likely driven by upper mantle convection
[@LePourhiet2006; @Jones2014].

The upper-mantle source of most xenolith suites in the Cordillera clearly
corresponds to surface geology: sub-continental xenolith suites are generally
erupted through cratonic and peri-cratonic crust, mantle wedge suites through
the Cretaceous large-volume batholith, and asthenospheric suites through active
rifts. However, xenoliths derived from underplated Farallon-plate material have
thus far only been recovered from inboard crustal domains in the eastern Mojave
province. This requires underplating with large sub-horizontal displacements
along a relatively shallow subduction megathrust system [@Helmstaedt1975;
@Lee2001b].

Restored for Neogene dextral faulting, the lithospheric block hosting
Crystal Knob was directly outboard of the Dish Hill xenolith locality
[@fig:context], where the mantle lithosphere is formed by Farallon nappes
underplated during the Cretaceous [@Luffi2009]. Accordingly, the mantle
lithosphere beneath the Coast Ranges may be composed of outboard equivalents of
these underplated nappes. However, the Coast Ranges are both proximal to
a subduction zone that was active until the early Neogene and directly above
the Pacific--Farallon slab window that developed at the end of this subduction.
The Crystal Knob xenolith suite provides an opportunity to resolve the
ambiguous mantle lithosphere architecture of coastal California and to
understand the effects of flat-slab subduction, microplate rotation and capture,
and ridge subduction on the deep structure of a subducting margin.
