Introduction
============

The tectonic and petrogenetic processes by which Earth’s continental mantle
lithosphere develops through time are of fundamental importance in geodynamics
and Earth history. Volcanic
rock-hosted mantle xenolith suites offer vertical sampling columns that reveal
compositions and textures of the deep lithosphere at the time of
xenolith entrainment and eruption. Petrogenetic studies of such xenolith suites
offer constraints on depth of entrainment, thermal gradients, and
geochemical evolutionary states. The integration of such constraints with
regional geophysical data, as well as tectonic and petrogenetic studies of the
overlying crust, offer critical insights into the interplay of plate tectonic
and geodynamic processes that assembled the deep mantle lithosphere.
In this contribution we present new petrologic and
geochemical data on the Pleistocene Crystal Knob volcanic neck-hosted mantle
xenolith locality of coastal central California, and integrate our findings
both with regional geophysical and modeling studies of the mantle
lithosphere and a well-developed literature on the
tectonic and petrogenetic development of the overlying crust.

The Crystal Knob xenolith locality samples a crucially important lithospheric
column through the Late Cretaceous convergent margin belt of the SW North
American Cordillera. This regionally extensive belt is characterized by
a voluminous continental magmatic arc,
generated as the Farallon oceanic plate subducted eastward beneath western
North America [@Ducea2015], and the Franciscan complex, the
crustal-level accretionary complex of this subduction zone. The
Franciscan is widely
recognized for its tectonic inclusion of Farallon plate oceanic basement and
pelagic sediment fragments, as well as upper plate
siliciclastic sediments derived from the magmatic arc
[@Cowan1978; @Murchey1984; @Sliter1984; @Blake1988; @Chapman2016; @Chapman2016a].
The crystalline basement of the "Salinian terrane" (or "Salinia") [@Page1981] has
recently been recognized as a series of far-displaced crystalline nappes, derived
from the southern California segment of the Late Cretaceous magmatic arc
and lying tectonically above Franciscan-affinity accretionary complex rocks in the
central California coastal area
[@Hall1991; @Barth2003; @Kidder2006; @Ducea2009; @Chapman2012; @Hall2013].
The Crystal Knob xenolith locality lies along the western margin
of Salinia, adjacent to the Nacimiento fault [@fig:context],
a polyphase structural zone which, in its original geometry,
constituted the local structural base of the
Salinian crystalline nappe sequence [@Hall2013]. In this setting,
the Crystal Knob xenolith suite samples the uppermost mantle that has been
constructed beneath both the Franciscan accretionary complex and its local
veneer of Salinia crystalline nappes.

## Regional tectonic setting and previous mantle xenolith studies

The SW North American Cordillera hosts many xenolith
localities, at which upper mantle-lower crustal rock fragments were entrained in
mainly late Cenozoic volcanic eruptions. Early studies of a number of these
xenolith suites focused on the systematizing of petrographic features and
classifying samples into textural groups [e.g. @Wilshire1988; @Nixon1987].
Subsequent application of modern geochemical and petrogenetic techniques has
led to the recognition of distinct regional mantle lithosphere domains
consisting of pre-Phanerozoic lithosphere, Cretaceous arc mantle wedge,
underplated Farallon plate nappes, and late Cenozoic shallow convective
asthenosphere
[e.g. @Galer1989; @Livaccari1993; @Alibert1994; @Beard1995; @Ducea1998a; @Jove1998; @Lee2001; @Usui2003; @Luffi2009].

These studies suggest a clear correspondence between xenolith-sampled
upper mantle domains and surface geology. Sub-continental suites
have generally been erupted through cratonic and peri-cratonic crust,
mantle wedge suites through the Cretaceous large-volume batholith,
and asthenospheric suites through active rifts.
In contrast, xenolith suites derived from
underplated Farallon plate mantle nappes have thus far only been recovered from
more inboard crustal domains, requiring large sub-horizontal displacements and
underplating along relatively shallow subduction megathrust systems [@Helmstaedt1975; @Lee2001b]. Crystal
Knob, having erupted through the Franciscan subduction accretionary complex,
presents a rare opportunity to sample mantle lithosphere directly beneath the
region of long-lived subduction accretion proximal to the plate edge.

The tectonic setting of the sub-Crystal Knob mantle lithosphere is best understood
by restoring its host crustal rocks to their position prior to San Andreas
transform offset. This places them outboard of the southern California batholith,
the southern continuation of the Sierra Nevada
batholith across the Garlock fault [@fig:context; @fig:reconstruction].
In this restored position, the crystalline nappes that constitute Salinia
correlate to deeply exhumed Cretaceous arc plutonic rocks of the southernmost
Sierra Nevada batholith and the northwestern zones of the southern California
batholith, the latter widely exposed in the Mojave plateau
[@Saleeby2003; @Barbeau2005; @Chapman2012]. These deeply exhumed batholithic
rocks share a common regional upper plate position above a polyphase
low-angle fault system below which Franciscan-affinity, mainly metaclastic rocks
were tectonically underplated in the Late Cretaceous
[@Malin1995; @Barth2003; @Yan2005; @Ducea2009; @Chapman2010; @Chapman2012; @Chapman2016b].
The underplated metaclastic rocks are exposed in a series of tectonic windows
that are labeled as subduction channel schists in @fig:context. Detritus for the
schist protoliths was derived from the upper plate batholithic belt, which
was rapidly uplifted above a shallow flat segment of the greater Franciscan
subduction megathrust system [@Barth2003; @Saleeby2007; @Chapman2013; @Chapman2016a].
The underplated schists tectonically encase blocks and
nappes of Farallon plate oceanic basement and sediments. The shallow flat
subduction megathrust segment is attributed to the ephemeral buoyancy
resulting from the subduction of the conjugate massif to the Shatsky Rise
oceanic LIP [@Livaccari1981; @Sliter1984; @Saleeby2003], which is
currently resolved in deep seismic tomographic images beneath the interior of
North America [@Liu2010; @Sun2017]. The tectonic position and structural
attenuation of the Salinia nappes, as well as adjacent (restored for
Neogene dextral faulting) deeply exhumed batholithic rocks, derives from both shallow
subduction megathrust displacements and subsequent large magnitude
trench-directed extensional faulting, correlated in time to the progress
of the Shatsky conjugate deeper into the mantle beneath the North American plate
[@Saleeby2003; @Liu2010; @Chapman2012].

Shallow tectonic underplating of the subduction-channel schists
directly beneath deep crustal large-volume batholithic rocks requires the prior
tectonic erosion of the mantle wedge lithosphere (the
source for the overlying batholith) and parts of the deepest arc crust.
Integrated mantle xenolith studies and deep seismic imaging document this process.
Late Miocene small-volume
volcanic flows and plugs from the central Sierra Nevada batholith [@fig:context]
carry xenolith suites that sampled the Cretaceous mantle wedge of the overlying
batholith [@Ducea1996; @Ducea1998a; @Lee2001; @Lee2006; @Saleeby2003].
The central and northern regions of the batholith are currently
exposed over shallow to medial crustal depths (2 to 4 kb pressure), whereas at
its southern reaches, a continuous
gradient to deep levels (10 kb) is exposed [@Nadin2008]. At this depth,
the shallow subduction
megathrust (remobilized as an extensional structure) forms the structural base of the batholith,
with the underplated
schists lying directly beneath [@Saleeby2003; @Chapman2010; @Chapman2012; @Chapman2016b].
Seismic reflection imaging shows an effectively flat megathrust beneath the western Mojave
plateau [@Yan2005] and dips of ~30ºN beneath the southernmost Sierra
Nevada region [@Malin1995]. The Garlock fault [@fig:context] nucleated during
the early Miocene along this inflection in the megathrust [@Saleeby2016],
which constituted a lateral ramp in the subduction
megathrust system [@Saleeby2003; @Chapman2016b]. In contrast to the
central Sierra xenolith suite, mantle xenoliths recovered from the eastern
margin of the southern California batholith record the partial tectonic erosion of
sub-continental mantle lithosphere (including Cretaceous mantle wedge), and the
underplating of Farallon plate mantle lithosphere [@Shervais1973; @Luffi2009; @Armytage2015; @Shields2016GSA].
More specifically, the Dish Hill suite [@fig:context] samples an upper
mantle duplex with imbricated nappes of Farallon plate oceanic mantle lying in
structural sequence beneath a relatively thin roof of attenuated continental
lithosphere peridotites. The mantle duplex is interpreted to have formed as the
Farallon plate retreated following Shatsky conjugate low-angle subduction
[@Luffi2009]. The reconstructed position of Crystal Knob, directly
outboard of the Dish Hill locality [@fig:context], as well as its
penetration of the Franciscan accretionary complex, suggests that
the Crystal Knob suite may have sampled additional underplated Farallon mantle
nappes outboard of the Dish Hill mantle duplex.

Mantle xenoliths of the eastern Sierra suite [@fig:context], viewed in the context of late
Cenozoic plate kinematics of the southern California region [@Argus1991; @Atwater1998]
suggest another potential origin for the sub-Crystal Knob upper mantle. The eastern Sierra suite occurs in
Pliocene-Quaternary mafic lava flows and records a significantly steeper
thermal gradient and more fertile compositions
than the Cretaceous mantle wedge suite from the central Sierra
[@Ducea1996; @Ducea1998b]. Seismic data from the eastern Sierra region
reveal asthenospheric mantle extending upwards to the base of the crust at ~30 km
depth [@Jones1998; @Zandt2004; @Frassetto2011; @Jones2014],
consistent with the eastern Sierra xenolith suite findings.
Xenolith-hosting lavas within the eastern Sierra suite were erupted within the <5 Ma
Owens Valley rift system [@fig:context], which is presumably driven by upper mantle convection.
Convective ascent of asthenosphere to relatively shallow levels and late
Cenozoic regional volcanism of the central to southern California region
[@Dodge1988] are
correlated with the opening of the Pacific-Farallon slab window
[@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005].  Both the eruption of Crystal Knob
and the origin of its upper mantle underpinnings could also owe their origins to
asthenosphere ascended into a slab window.

Below we investigate the petrology and
geochemistry of the Crystal Knob suite and link it to
regional findings on other xenolith locations, as well as geophysical data and
modeling, in order to pursue the origin of the upper mantle beneath the Crystal
Knob eruption site and the central California Coast Ranges more
generally.
