Introduction
============

The tectonic and petrogenetic processes by which Earth’s continental mantle
lithosphere develops through time are of fundamental importance in geodynamics
and Earth history. What are the relative roles of subduction accretion versus
subduction erosion of mantle lithosphere fragments, and what
petrologic-geochemical processes operate to ultimately stabilize mantle
lithosphere beneath newly formed continental crustal tracts?  Volcanic
rock-hosted mantle xenolith suites offer vertical sampling columns that reveal
the compositional and textural states of lithospheric sections at the time of
xenolith entrainment and eruption. Petrogenetic studies of such xenolith suites
offer constraints on depth intervals of entrainment, thermal gradients, and
geochemical evolutionary states. The integration of such constraints with
regional geophysical data, and with tectonic and petrogenetic studies of the
overlying crust offer critical insights into the interplay of plate tectonic
and geodynamic processes responsible for the current state of region specific
lithospheric domains. In this contribution we present new petrologic and
geochemical data on the Pleistocene Crystal Knob volcanic neck-hosted mantle
xenolith locality of coastal central California, and integrate our findings
with regional geophysical data and modeling, and with a wealth of data on the
tectonic and petrogenetic development of the overlying crust.

The Crystal Knob xenolith locality samples a highly strategic lithospheric
column through the Late Cretaceous convergent margin belt of the SW North
American Cordillera. This regionally extensive belt is characterized by
a large-volume continental magmatic arc,
generated as the Farallon oceanic plate subducted eastward beneath western
North America [@Ducea2015]. The Franciscan complex represents the
crustal level accretionary complex of this subduction zone, and is widely
recognized for its tectonic inclusion of Farallon plate oceanic basement and
pelagic sediment fragments, as well as upper plate magmatic arc derived
siliciclastic sediments
[@Cowan1978; @Murchey1984; @Sliter1984; @Blake1988; @Chapman2016a]
Recently, it has been recognized
that a series of far out of place crystalline nappes that were derived from the
southern California segment of the Late Cretaceous magmatic arc lie
tectonically above Franciscan-affinity accretionary complex rocks in the
central California coastal area
[@Barth2003; @Kidder2006; @Ducea2009; @Chapman2012; @Hall2013].
In aggregate
these crystalline nappes have been called “Salinia”, or the “Salinian terrane”
[@Page1981]. The Crystal Knob xenolith locality lies along the western margin
of Salinia, adjacent to the Nacimiento fault [@fig:context],
a polyphase structural zone which, in its original geometry,
constituted the local structural base of the
Salinia crystalline nappe sequence [@Hall2013]. In this setting
the crystal Knob xenolith suite samples the uppermost mantle that has been
constructed beneath both the Franciscan accretionary complex and its local
veneer of Salinia crystalline nappes.

## Regional tectonic setting and the application of mantle xenolith studies

The SW North American Cordillera hosts many xenolith
localities, at which upper mantle-lower crustal rock fragments were entrained in
mainly late Cenozoic volcanic eruptions. Early studies of a number of these
xenolith suites focused on the systematizing of petrographic features and
classifying various samples into petrographic groups [@Wilshire1988].
Subsequent application of modern geochemical and petrogenetic techniques has
led to the recognition of distinct regional mantle lithosphere domains
consisting of pre-Phanerozoic lithosphere, Cretaceous arc mantle wedge,
underplated Farallon plate nappes, and late Cenozoic shallow convective
asthenosphere
[@Galer1989; @Livaccari1993; @Alibert1994; @Beard1995; @Ducea1996, @Ducea1998a; @Jove1998; @Lee2001; @Lee2006; @Usui2003; @Luffi2009].

These studies suggest clear correspondence between xenolith-sampled
upper mantle domains and surface geology. Sub-continental suites
have generally been erupted through cratonic and peri-cratonic crust,
mantle wedge suites erupted through the Cretaceous large volume batholith,
and asthenospheric suites erupted through active rifts.
In contrast, xenolith suites derived from
underplated Farallon plate mantle nappes have thus far only been recovered from
more inboard crustal domains, requiring large sub-horizontal displacements and
underplating along relatively shallow subduction megathrust systems. Crystal
Knob, having erupted through the Franciscan subduction accretionary complex,
presents a rare opportunity to sample mantle lithosphere directly beneath the
region of long-lived subduction accretion proximal to the plate edge.

The tectonic setting of the sub-Crystal Knob mantle lithosphere is best posed
by restoring its host crustal rocks to their position prior to San Andreas
transform offset. This places them outboard of the northern reaches of the southern California batholith, the southern continuation of the Sierra Nevada
batholith across the Garlock fault (@fig:context and @fig:reconstruction, detailed below). In this restored position the crystalline nappes that constitute Salinia
correlate to deeply exhumed Cretaceous arc plutonic rocks of the southernmost
Sierra Nevada batholith and the northwestern zones of the southern California
batholith, the latter widely exposed in ranges of the Mojave plateau
[@Saleeby2003; @Barbeau2005; @Chapman2012]. These deeply exhumed batholithic
rocks share a common regional upper plate position above a polyphase
low-angle fault system below which Franciscan-affinity, mainly metaclastic rocks,
were tectonically underplated in the Late Cretaceous
[@Malin1995; @Barth2003; @Yan2005; @Ducea2009; @Chapman2010; @Chapman2012 @Chapman2016b].
The underplated metaclastic rocks are exposed in a series of windows
that are labeled as subduction channel schists in @fig:context. Detritus for the
schist protoliths was derived from the upper plate batholithic belt that was
vigorously uplifted above a shallow flat segment of the greater Franciscan
subduction megathrust system [@Barth2003; @Saleeby2007; @Chapman2013; @Chapman2016a].
The underplated schists tectonically encase blocks and
nappes of Farallon plate oceanic basement and sediments. The shallow flat
subduction megathrust segment is attributed to the ephemeral buoyancy effect
resulting from the subduction of the conjugate massif to the Shatsky Rise
oceanic LIP [@Livaccari1981; @Sliter1984; @Saleeby2003], which is
currently resolved in deep seismic tomographic images beneath the interior of
North America [@Liu2010; @Sun2017]. The tectonic position and state of structural
attenuation of the Salinia nappes, as well as adjacent (Salinia restored
position) deeply exhumed batholithic rocks, derives from both shallow
subduction megathrust displacements, and subsequent large magnitude
trench-directed extensional faulting that correlates in time to the Shatsky
conjugate progressing deeper into the mantle beneath the North American plate
[@Saleeby2003; @Liu2010; @Chapman2012].

The relatively shallow level of the tectonic underplating of the schists
directly beneath deep crustal large-volume batholithic rocks requires the prior
tectonic erosion of the mantle lithosphere (mantle wedge) that hosted the
source regime for the overlying batholith. Integrated mantle xenolith studies
and deep seismic imaging document this process.  Late Miocene small volume
volcanic flows and plugs from the central Sierra Nevada batholith [@fig:context]
carry xenolith suites that sampled the Cretaceous mantle wedge of the overlying
batholith [@Ducea1996, @Ducea1998a; @Lee2001, @Lee2006; @Saleeby2003].
The central and northern regions of the batholith are currently
exposed over shallow to medial crustal depths (2 to 4 kb pressure), whereas at
its southern reaches traversing towards the Garlock fault, a continuous
gradient to deep levels (10 kb) is exposed [@Nadin2008]. At these
deep levels the structural base of the batholith consists of the normal sense
remobilized shallow subduction megathrust, beneath which lie the underplated
schists [@Saleeby2003; @Chapman2010, @Chapman2012, @Chapman2016b]. Seismic reflection
data image the megathrust as effectively flat beneath the western Mojave
plateau [@Yan2005], and dipping ~30ºN beneath the southernmost Sierra
Nevada region [@Malin1995]. The Garlock fault [@fig:context] nucleated during
the early Miocene along this inflection in the megathrust [@Saleeby2016],
which constituted a lateral ramp in the subduction
megathrust system [@Saleeby2003; @Chapman2016b]. In contrast to the
central Sierra xenolith suite, mantle xenoliths recovered from the eastern
margin of the southern California batholith record the tectonic erosion of
sub-continental mantle lithosphere (including Cretaceous mantle wedge), and the
underplating of Farallon plate mantle lithosphere [@Shervais1973; @Luffi2009; @Shields2016GSA].
More specifically the Dish Hill suite [@fig:context] samples an upper
mantle duplex with imbricated nappes of Farallon plate oceanic mantle lying in
structural sequence beneath a relatively thin roof of attenuated continental
lithosphere peridotites. The mantle duplex is interpreted to have formed as the
Farallon plate retreated following Shatsky conjugate low-angle subduction
[@Luffi2009]. The reconstructed position of Crystal Knob, directly
outboard of the Dish Hill locality [@fig:context], as well as the neck having
penetrated the Franciscan accretionary complex, clearly poses the question of
the Crystal Knob suite having sampled additional underplated Farallon mantle
nappes, in structural sequence with the Dish Hill mantle duplex.

Mantle xenoliths of the eastern Sierra suite [@fig:context], viewed in the context of late
Cenozoic plate kinematics of the southern California region [@Argus1991; @Atwater1998]
pose another viable possibility for the sub-Crystal Knob upper mantle. The eastern Sierra suite occurs in
Pliocene-Quaternary mafic lava flows, and records a significantly steeper
thermal gradient and compositions much closer to that of the convecting mantle
than the Cretaceous mantle wedge suite from the central Sierra
(@Ducea1996, @Ducea1998b). Seismic data from the eastern Sierra region
reveal asthenospheric mantle extending upwards to the base of the crust at ~30 km
depth [@Jones1998; @Zandt2004; @Frassetto2011; @Jones2014],
consistent with the eastern Sierra xenolith suite findings.
The xenolith sites within the eastern Sierra suite were erupted within the <10 Ma
Owens Valley rift system [@fig:context], which is presumably driven by upper mantle convection.
Convective ascent of asthenosphere to relatively shallow levels and late
Cenozoic regional volcanism of the central to southern California region are
correlated to the opening of the Pacific-Farallon slab window
[@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005].  Both the eruption of the Crystal Knob
neck and the origin of its upper mantle underpinnings could also owe their origins to
asthenosphere ascended into a slab window.

Below we investigate the petrology and
geochemistry of the Crystal Knob suite, in conjunction with
regional findings on other xenolith locations as well as geophysical data and
modeling, in order to pursue the origin of the upper mantle beneath the Crystal
Knob eruption site and the central California Coast Ranges more
generally.
