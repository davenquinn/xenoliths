## Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopes

<!--[[isotopes]]-->

Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd radiogenic isotope data for clinopyroxene separates show
these samples to be derived from the depleted convecting mantle. 
All xenolith samples are enriched in radiogenic \ce{^{143}Nd}
($\epsilon_{\textrm{Nd}}$ from 10.3 to 11.0) and depleted in
\ce{^{87}Sr} (\ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .702). This pattern of strong
depletion in large-ion-lithophile elements rules out a continental
lithosphere or Mesozoic mantle wedge source and suggests an origin in the
asthenospheric or underplated oceanic mantle
[@DePaolo1976b;@McCulloch1978].
