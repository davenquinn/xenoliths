# Geothermal constraints on the deep lithosphere

## Extrapolation from surface heat flow {#sec:heat-flow}

Previous studies have used surface heat flows to estimate the thermal structure
and evolution of the mantle lithosphere beneath the central California coast
ranges. @Blackwell2004 compiled a heat flow database across the western U.S.
based on borehole measurements in wells > 100 m deep. A "Coast Range Thermal
Anomaly" of high surface heat flux (70-90 mW/m^2) spans the entire Coast Range
belt, both inboard and outboard of the San Andreas fault zone. These heat flows
are similar to the Mojave province but much higher than in the adjacent Central
Valley and Sierra Nevada (20-40 mW/m^2). Coast Range heat flows are high in the
global distribution of regionally averaged continental heat flows, which range
from lows of 20 mW/m^2 in cratonic cores to 120 mW/m^2 in focused areas of
active mantle upwelling (e.g. the southern Salton Trough) [@Pollack1977;
@Erkan2009].

@Erkan2009 attributed high surface heat flows in the Coast Ranges to
non-conductive processes such as shear heating, rapid surface uplift, and fluid
circulation along faults. Shear heating does not cause significant
additions to heat flow [e.g @Lachenbruch1980; @Kidder2013]. However,
sustained rock uplift and erosion, such as that documented since 2 Ma in
the Santa Lucia Range [@Ducea2003b], can raise the crustal geothermal
gradient through advection of material. More significantly, regional
thermal conductivity can be enhanced by hydrothermal circulation in the
presence of fractures. The crust of the Coast Ranges and the Mojave
province underwent extensive crustal detachment faulting during the late
Cretaceous [@Wood1997; @Chapman2012], and overprinted Neogene transform
faulting in the Coast Ranges. Mantle fluids in the San Andreas fault zone
[@Kennedy1997] suggest the fluid upwelling along these fractures.
High surface heat flows in these areas may
be due to increased permeability, fracture-following fluid transport,
and heat advection. In contrast, the intact
batholithic domains underlying the Sierra Nevada, Central Valley, and
Peninsular Ranges have relatively low heat flows [@Erkan2009].

Non-conductive heat transport
can significantly impact the extrapolation of lithospheric geotherms
from surface heat flows, and conductive
geotherms anchored at the surface may overestimate mantle lithosphere temperatures. Accordingly, mantle lithosphere
temperatures modeled by seismic tomography are cooler than those
extrapolated from surface heat flows. @Goes2002 predicts
temperatures of 700--1100ºC at 50--100 km depth beneath coastal
California, suggesting < 60 mW/m^2 steady-state heat flows. @Li2007
estimates the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary to be at ~70
km depth in the southern Coast Ranges. With a 1200-1300ºC
lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary [e.g. @OReilly2010; @Fischer2010], this
corresponds to steady-state heat flows of 70-80 mW/m^2.

Steady-state geotherms extrapolated from surface heat flows generalize
the heat-transfer properties of the entire lithospheric column, and thus
provide only first-order constraints on mantle lithosphere thermal
state. Measurements of temperature and depth of xenolith equilibration
can allow more direct reconstruction the deep lithospheric geotherm.

## Depth constraints from Crystal Knob xenoliths

<!--[[[fig:depth]]]-->

The depths of the xenolith samples in the mantle lithosphere, coupled
with equilibration temperatures, provide a direct constraint on the
geotherm beneath Crystal Knob at the time of eruption. Pyroxene-exchange
geothermometry shows that the peridotite samples form two temperature groups
with centroids separated by roughly 60ºC. This temperature range likely
corresponds to an array of sample sources along a depth gradient. For spinel
peridotites, equilibration depths can only be analytically estimated within
broad boundaries. With no reliable geobarometers for spinel peridotites,
several less robust metrics are used to evaluate the depth of the xenolith
source. We present several lines of reasoning suggesting that the samples were
entrained from relatively deep in the spinel stability field (~45-75 km).
Several of the techniques below produce estimates of pressure, rather than
depth. We convert these to depths using a hydrostatic gradient of ~0.03 GPa/km,
integrating crust and mantle densities given in @tbl:model_parameters.

### Limits of spinel stability

Entrainment depths of all peridotite xenoliths must be greater than ~30 km,
the depth of the Moho near the Crystal Knob eruption site [@Trehu1991], which
will be discussed in more detail in @sec:tectonic_scenarios. The
plagioclase--spinel peridotite facies transition (typically at 20-30 km) is
another minimum depth constraint, but it is highly composition-dependent
[@Green1970a], with high-Cr harzburgites stable to the surface [@Borghini2009].

The high-pressure boundary of spinel stability limits maximum possible
entrainment depths.
The spinel--garnet peridotite facies transition is
composition-dependent and poorly constrained for
natural systems, but thought to lie over the 50-80 km depth interval
[@ONeill1981; @Kinzler1997; @Gasparik2000; @Klemme2004].
The breakdown depth of spinel is strongly dependent on temperature and composition, particularly
the amount of refractory Cr hosted by spinel.
Several experimental and thermodynamic studies have estimated the
magnitude of this effect. @ONeill1981 presented experiments both with and
without Cr and described a simple empirical relationship of spinel-out depth
with Cr content and temperature. @Robinson1998 suggests that, given fertile
"pyrolite" compositions with little Cr, garnet is unstable at depths less than
80 km at the peridotite solidus (~1470ºC at this depth). Subsolidus
experimental results show that the maximum depth of the spinel stability field
in the absence of Cr ranges from 1.8-2.0 GPa (55-60 km) at 1000-1200ºC
[@Klemme2000]. Chromian spinels are stable to much greater depth: thermodynamic
modeling by @Klemme2004 suggests a broad garnet-spinel co-stability field (up
to a spinel-out reaction at 5 GPa for Cr# of ~30), but a spinel-weighted
metastable assemblage is possible even at higher pressures.

Samples in the high-temperature cohort (CK-3, CK-4, and CK-6) have high spinel
Cr# due to their history of depletion by partial melting
[@fig:major_elements|c]. This enrichment in refractory Cr expands the stability
field of spinel against garnet to deeper depths. Though @Robinson1998,
@Klemme2000, and @Klemme2004 show a high-pressure phase transition with
a complex compositional dependence, the rough estimate of the garnet-in
pressure given by @ONeill1981 performs sufficiently well at T < 1200 ºC. This
empirical relationship is used in @fig:depth to graphically illustrate the
predicted depth of the spinel-garnet phase-transition based on the Cr# of each
sample. This simple treatment provides a high-pressure constraint on the
Crystal Knob xenolith source. The maximum possible entrainment depth of the
highest-Cr residual samples is ~80 km, versus ~65 km for the low-Cr samples.

### Ca-in-olivine barometer

Equilibration pressure measurements are attempted for the peridotite xenoliths
using the @Kohler1990 Ca-in-olivine barometer, which is based on the decreasing
abundance of Ca in olivine with pressure. This barometer is
calibrated for spinel peridotites but its accuracy is limited by
poor resolution, high temperature dependence, vulnerability to late-stage
diffusion, and dependence on low Ca concentrations in olivine near analytical
thresholds for electron microprobe analysis [@Medaris1999; @OReilly1997].

Within each sample, pressures are calculated separately for nearest-neighbor
pyroxene and olivine measurements, and analytical errors are propagated through
the calculation. Measured olivine Ca concentrations of ~200-400 ppm are
scattered within each sample but separable [@fig:ca_in_olivine]. To correct for
the mild pressure dependence of the two-pyroxene thermometer and coupled
temperature dependence of the olivine barometer, we jointly solve temperature
and pressure by iterative optimization. This yields internally consistent pressure
and temperature measurements for each set of analytical points. For each
pressure estimate, sensitivity to analytical errors is explored using
Monte Carlo random sampling ($n=100,000$).
The density of the resulting
error space yields a probable depth
range for each sample [@fig:depth].

<!--[[[fig:ca_in_olivine]]]-->

The Ca-in-olivine barometer yields model depths with
modes between 40 and 53 km, largely coincident with the spinel stability field
[@fig:depth]. Within the Crystal Knob sample set, the low and high-temperature
cohorts remain separable, with high-temperature samples showing deeper
equilibrium depths. The scale of errors within a single sample reflects the
barometer's strong covariance with major-element thermometers, as well as its
sensitivity to small variations in Ca concentrations. Much of the spread in
the data reflects the poor calibration of the barometer: the
low-temperature samples in particular have significant scatter towards depths
above the spinel-in isograd. The large Ca cation diffuses rapidly during
transient heating [@Kohler1990], producing a shallowing bias on the depth
distribution. This may explain why CK-4, which apparently experienced a unique
transient heating event, has a depth mode ~10 km shallower than
samples with similar equilibration temperatures (CK-3 and CK-6). Likewise,
higher REE temperatures for samples CK-4 and CK-6 may indicate a
slightly deeper source. Despite the
imprecision of the method, Ca-in-olivine barometry suggests that the samples
were sourced from >40 km, relatively deep within the spinel stability field.

### Comparisons with steady-state heat flow

Estimates of xenolith depth can be constructed by pinning the equilibrium
temperatures of the Crystal Knob samples to a conductive geotherm constrained
by surface heat flux. On @fig:depth, we show a range of geothermal gradients
corresponding to surface heat fluxes of 60-120 mW/m^2. These are calculated
using values for thermal conductivity and diffusivity given in
@tbl:model_parameters for the crust to a depth of 30 km, and mantle lithosphere
below this level. The empirical factor of 0.6 proposed by @Pollack1977 is used to reduce
surface heat flux to a presumed mantle contribution, with the remainder being
taken up by radiogenic heat production near the surface. Radiogenic heating
is modeled to decrease exponentially with depth, with an $e$-folding
length scale of 10 km. Mantle heat flux and lithospheric thermal conductivity
are the main controls on the slope of the modeled geothermal gradient. This
methodology is developed in @Turcotte2002 and is identical to that used by
@Luffi2009, except that crustal thermal conductivity is reduced to match the
conditions used in dynamic thermal modeling [@sec:modeling]. This yields
a slightly "hotter" geotherm throughout the mantle lithosphere.

Depths of entrainment can be estimated by projecting the TA98 temperatures for
each sample onto these model geotherms. Geotherms corresponding to all
reasonable surface heat flows suggest entrainment over a depth range of 5-10 km
within the mantle lithosphere, with the hotter samples more deeply sourced.
Steady-state geotherms anchored to surface heat flows of 65-120 mW/m^2 place
the Crystal Knob sample set within the spinel stability field, and 70-110 mW/m^2
surface heat flows limit depths to the range modeled by Ca-in-olivine barometry.
Measured surface heat flows of 80-90 mW/m^2 for the central
California coast [@Erkan2009] suggest depths of ~45-55 km for the Crystal Knob
sample set.

## Discussion of xenolith geothermal constraints

The Crystal Knob xenoliths are sourced within the mantle lithosphere, deeper
than 30 km (the Moho) and shallower than the 60-90 km lower boundary of the
spinel stability field. Ca-in-olivine barometry suggests tighter constraints
near the center of the spinel stability field.
Model depths of 45-55 km from steady-state geotherms agree with
xenolith thermobarometry but may be underestimates due to potential
non-conductive heat transfer through the crust [@sec:heat-flow]. Given the
bias of both Ca-in-olivine and heat-flow measurements towards shallower depths,
we suggest that the xenoliths were likely entrained at 45-75 km depth.
This implies that the thermal structure of the mantle lithosphere can be
modeled by conductive geotherms with ~65-90 mW/m^2 steady-state heat flow.
Relatively deep entrainment of the Crystal Knob xenoliths
along a fairly "cool" lithospheric geotherm conforms to constraints from
independent studies.

## Geochemical variation with depth and temperature {#sec:PT-geochemical-variation}

The Crystal Knob peridotite xenoliths vary in composition with temperature,
with two separable cohorts that sample mantle material with somewhat different
major- and trace-element characteristics.  Major-element and REE
depletion track together and generally increase with the equilibration
temperature of the sample, with the notable exception of sample CK-6. These
differences in temperature are implicitly linked to a gradient in entrainment
depth.

The low-temperature and shallower cohort includes phases
with relatively fertile compositions in both major and trace elements.
The samples have phase compositions similar to depleted MORB
mantle [@Workman2005], and clinopyroxene trace elements
range from essentially undepleted to low levels of depletion
characteristic of the least-depleted abyssal peridotites
[@fig:trace_elements].

The higher-temperature, deeper samples CK-3 and CK-4 contain phases with high
Mg\#s, which suggests that all phases lost incompatible elements during
high-degree depletion. These features, along with high levels of REE depletion,
extremely low clinopyroxene modes, and chromian spinels, indicate significant
melt extraction. Distinct enrichments in LREE likely correspond to
assimilation of a fractionated melt, though this is modeled to be
volumetrically insignificant.

Sample CK-6, the hottest and deepest sample, has a highly enriched
major-element composition, and is only moderately depleted in HREEs. However,
high modal abundance of pyroxenes and spinel, and simultaneously elevated Cr,
Al, and LREE suggest both significant depletion and re-enrichment. This is
bolstered by petrographic evidence of substantial intergrowth and aggregation
of pyroxene grains, unique in the sample set. Elevated REE-in-two-pyroxene
temperatures for samples CK-4 and CK-6 suggest a fossil heating event not shown
in major-element thermometry. This event may have been more completely felt by
sample CK-6, which has a fully equilibrated REE temperature measurement
[@fig:ree_temperatures] and appears to have assimilated a sizable amount of
enriched material.

The pattern of increasing depletion with depth suggests increased melt
extraction deeper in the lithospheric column, at odds with the decrease in
melting degrees with depth expected for decompression melting. Also, the
geochemical variation between undepleted and depleted/re-enriched samples
within a <10 km depth range suggests potential lateral heterogeneity to
melting. @Luffi2009 found a similar inverted pattern within mantle lithosphere
packages beneath Dish Hill, ascribing fertile lherzolites at the top of the
package to refertilization of suboceanic mantle lithosphere. With the exception
of sample CK-6, HREE refertilization of the Crystal Knob samples is
unlikely due to consistent major- and trace-element chemistry.

The low-temperature samples are petrologically similar to abyssal peridotites
\[@fig:modes and -@fig:trace_elements\], suggesting a fertile to
moderately-depleted suboceanic mantle lithosphere origin. The depleted harzburgites
CK-3 and CK-4 could be tectonically juxtaposed to deeper levels by duplexing
[as in @Luffi2009] or depleted after emplacement by deeply-sourced melting.
Along these lines, the obvious refertilization of CK-6 at the base of the
column shows melt-rock interactions that were most intense at deep levels. This
spatial pattern of melt generation is commonly associated with flux melting
in subarc settings [e.g. @Jean2010] but could also arise from intense heating
from below [@Thorkelson2005]. In this context, the depletion of the deeper
samples at Crystal Knob would correspond to melt generation deep within the
mantle lithosphere.
