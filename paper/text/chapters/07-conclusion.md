# Discussion of lithospheric history

Of the three plausible scenarios depicted for the evolution of the sub-Crystal
Knob mantle lithosphere [@fig:neogene_sections], we reject scenario **A**,
asthenosphere emplaced in a shallow slab window, which predicts temperatures
much hotter than the xenolith-sampled geotherm beneath the Coast Ranges. Both
the Monterey plate stalled slab (**B**) and Cretaceous-underplated Farallon
mantle nappe cases (**C**) are plausible based on our thermal modeling.
However, the geotherm predicted for the Monterey Plate stalled slab occupies
the higher-temperature part of the acceptable field, and its viability may be
affected by erosion in the Coast Ranges, which would tend to elevate geotherms
for all cases.

@Erkan2008 model the thermal structure of the lithosphere beneath the Coast
Ranges based on projected surface heat flow, and reject a shallow
asthenospheric slab window in favor of the underplated stalled slab, which
predicts lithospheric geotherms within acceptable bounds. Our modeling broadly
replicates their results, but our additional scenario **C** also predicts
reasonable geotherms in the mantle lithosphere.

Despite the inability to reject the stalled slab based on thermal modeling
alone, we reject it in favor of scenario **C**, Cretaceous underplated mantle
lithosphere heated at depth by the Neogene slab window. This scenario was
constructed based on the architecture of the lithospheric mantle in the Mojave
region and the crustal geologic structure of southern California from the
Cretaceous to the Neogene, and is consistent with a wide literature on the
tectonics and geodynamics of the Cordilleran margin [e.g. @Luffi2009; @Liu2010;
@Chapman2012]. Furthermore, there are many geologic and geodynamic reasons to
discount feasibility of the stalled slab model for lithospheric underplating,
which we detail in @sec:stalled-slab-bad below.

@fig:neogene_sections|c shows our preferred model for the modern architecture
of the mantle lithosphere beneath the Coast Ranges. The partially subducted
terminus of the Monterey plate is bounded to the east by the San
Gregorio-Hosgri fault. East of the fault, the Nacimiento-belt Franciscan
complex and its tectonic veneer of Salinia nappes (not differentiated on the
figure) and associated lower crustal oceanic crustal duplex lie tectonically
above underplated Farallon-plate mantle nappes. The structural profile shown on
@fig:neogene_sections|c closely follows the structure of offshore seismic lines
in the region [@Trehu1991], and the part between the San Andreas and San
Gregorio-Hosgri faults restores to southern California latitudes, adjacent to
the Mojave plateau and extended southern California batholith. Partial
subduction and stalling of the Monterey plate occurred along the outer edge of
the Franciscan complex, a further ~250 km south of the structural profile shown
here [@fig:reconstruction].

## Geodynamic implausibility of the Neogene stalled slab{#sec:stalled-slab-bad}

The Monterey plate nucleated along a ~250 km segment of the Pacific-Farallon
ridge as an oblique rift that was rotated ~25º clockwise from the
Pacific-Farallon rift axis [@Atwater1989]. Its generation was synchronous with
the early stages of Pacific-Farallon plate convergence into the Cordilleran
subduction zone along the southern California coastal region, and coincided
with transrotational rifting of the continental borderland region and
displacement of the western Transverse Ranges bedrock [@Bohannon1995;
@Atwater1998].

The current position of the Monterey plate offshore of the Crystal Knob
eruption site is a result of dextral displacements linked to borderland
transrotational rifting, subsequent ~155 km-scale dextral offsets along the San
Gregorio-Hosgri fault system, and ~100 km of additional dextral offsets in the
offshore region [@fig:context] as modeled both by geologic reconstruction of
fault offsets [@Dickinson2005] and plate kinematic reconstructions
[@Wilson2005]. Continuation of the Monterey plate east of the San
Gregorio-Hosgri fault requires the lateral translation of its downdip extension
along the former subduction interface beneath the Coast Ranges. Its
hypothetical extension east of the San Andreas fault requires that this
subduction interface likewise extended eastwards beyond the San Andreas fault
[e.g. @Brocher1999; @tenBrink1999; @Pikser2012]. Seismological, geodynamic, and
surface geological evidence presented here argues against models invoking
horizontal translation of the Monterey plate "remnant slab”, beneath both the
Coast Ranges and Central Valley.

### Cessation of transrotational rifting

In the @fig:reconstruction reconstruction, the future Crystal Knob eruption
site sits above the Pacific-Farallon slab window ~50-100 km north of the
northeast margin of the partially subducted Monterey plate. The narrow slab
window segment east of the Peninsular Ranges marks the plate’s separation locus
with the Farallon plate, which subsequently opened wider beneath the southern
California region as the Farallon plate descended deeper into the mantle
[@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005]. From ~22 to 10 Ma, the Monterey plate, already
coupled to the Pacific plate, diverged from North America. This likely caused
the underthrust portion of the Monterey Plate to be extensionally attenuated
[@Bohannon1995]. Coupling of Monterey plate rotation across the stalled
subduction megathrust is hypothesized to have driven dextral transrotational
rifting of the southern California borderland [@Nicholson1994; @Bohannon1995].

As western Transverse Range crustal panels rotated to their current position at
the end of borderland transrotation (~10 Ma), the Monterey plate was displaced
northward along the San Gregorio-Hosgri fault system [@fig:context], which is
on-trend with the outer edge of the Farallon-Monterey slab window
[@fig:reconstruction]. In conjunction with the sudden cessation of crustal
transrotation, the Monterey Plate likely separated from its underplated
extension.

### Horizontal translation of a stalled slab

If the subducted portion of the Monterey Plate maintained its structural
integrity following borderland transrotational rifting and was not cut by the
San Gregorio-Hosgri fault, it would be translated northward beneath the Coast
Ranges on a shallowly dipping fault surface (presumably, the remobilized
subduction megathrust) to remain attached its Pacific plate abyssal fragment
after ~10 Ma [@fig:neogene_sections|c]. This geometry has been proposed to
extend beneath the entire Coast Ranges and east of the San Andreas fault [e.g.
@tenBrink1999; @Pikser2012]. Although kinematically plausible, in theory, this
is unlikely based on dynamic factors: a large mantle mass at the base of the
crust should cause transients in dynamic topography and brittle crustal
deformation in response to coupling across the shallow fault. Such surface
deformation patterns are not expressed north of the Transverse Ranges during
the Neogene.

Studies proposing a deep Monterey plate stalled slab [e.g. @Furlong1989;
@Pikser2012] have suggested that translation of the Monterey plate along the
San Andreas system entailed significant sub-horizontal fault segments that
accommodated dextral displacements. As of yet, however, all seismically imaged
segments of the transform system have been shown to be steeply oriented
[@Dietz1990; @Brocher1999; @Yan2005; @Titus2007; @Yan2007; @Ozacar2009].


### Lower-crustal seismic structure

In seismic data, distinct steps and inflections in lower crustal velocity
structure across San Gregorio-Hosgri fault system [@Brocher1999] indicates that
it cuts the entire crust, likely forming the eastern boundary of the
underplated Monterey plate. Additionally, offshore seismic observations show
a ~16º eastward-dipping Monterey plate, with a typical abyssal crustal
thickness, juxtaposed against a nearly flat thickened lower crustal layer
beneath the Nacimiento Franciscan [@Trehu1991; @Nicholson1992]. These
observations directly conflict with the notion that a structurally continuous
Monterey Plate constitutes the lower crust beneath the central coastal
California and adjacent offshore region.

Seismic data cited in support of a structurally continuous stalled slab consist
of an 8-15 km thick, shallowly east-dipping mafic lower crustal layer that
extends beneath central California from the offshore region into proximity of
the San Andreas fault, thickening eastwards over Moho depths of ~12-30 km
[@Brocher1999]. This layer purportedly represents the continuous surface of the
stalled Monterey plate beneath coastal central California. Strong internal
reflectivity within this layer [@Trehu1987; @Brocher1999], and sharp
inflections in its upper surface [@Trehu1991], indicate that this mafic layer
is internally deformed and imbricated, which accounts for its thickness
exceeding typical oceanic mafic crust by a factor of two to three. Such
imbrication and underplating require a basal detachment, which is most
logically located at the underlying Moho. In this context, the regions’s
lower-crustal mafic layer is more plausibly interpreted as a regional
underplated duplex of Farallon plate oceanic crustal nappes that accreted
during Franciscan subduction [@fig:neogene_sections|c].

### The origin of the Isabella seismic anomaly

Studies proposing a horizontally-translated slab projecting eastward beneath
the San Andreas fault [e.g. @Pikser2012; @Wang2013] typically propose a steeply
dipping eastward extension corresponding to the high-wave speed anomaly of the
southern Sierra Nevada-Great Valley region [@fig:context], commonly called the
“Isabella anomaly”.

Seismological and geodynamic studies
show that the Isabella anomaly is derived primarily from the convectively
mobilized mantle wedge, or mantle lithosphere, of the southern Sierra Nevada
batholith [@Zandt2004; @Frassetto2011; @Gilbert2012; @Saleeby2012; @Jones2014;
@Levandowski2015]. These studies show structural continuity between the seismic
anomaly and the residual mantle lithosphere that is still in place beneath the
Central Valley and Sierra Nevada [@fig:context] and suggest that the volume of
the Isabella anomaly far exceeds the reasonable size of an attenuated terminus
of a hypothetical translated Monterey slab. These studies also provide
mechanisms for lower crustal plastic deformation, observable surface faulting,
upper mantle--lower crustal partial melting and dynamic topographic effects
that are ignored in the stalled-slab hypothesis.

First-order geological effects such as volcanism and
topographic transients are closely correlated to the convective mobilization of
the sub-Sierran mantle lithosphere and its current expression as the Isabella
anomaly [@Ducea1998b; @Farmer2002; @Saleeby2013; @Cecil2014; @Levandowski2015].
The surface effects of Monterey plate partial subduction, followed by
transtensional coupling to the Pacific plate, are closely correlated to
transrotational rifting in the southern California Borderland and the linked
clockwise rotation of western Transverse Ranges bedrock panels [@Bohannon1995;
@Wilson2005]. This is in line with the Monterey slab’s limited down-dip extent
as bounded by the Monterey-Farallon slab window segment shown in
@fig:reconstruction. If the hypothetical Monterey "relict slab" were of proper
proportion to form the Isabella anomaly, then why were its effects on surface
geology restricted to the Borderland and Transverse Ranges? Epeirogenic
transients that correlate to the convective mobilization of the sub-Sierran
mantle lithosphere as the Isabella anomaly are highly out of phase with the
predicted translation pattern for a deep Monterey slab [@Saleeby2013;
@Cecil2014]. Possible remnants of necked-off, partially subducted Monterey
plate are more plausibly correlated to the Transverse Ranges high-wave speed
anomaly in terms of position and volume [@fig:context], and also have a firm
geodynamic basis as such [@Burkett2009].

Much of the attractiveness of the stalled slab hypothesis lies in its utility
to explain limited Neogene volcanism and low modern crustal heat flow in the
Coast Ranges, neither of which can correspond to shallow underplated
asthenosphere emplaced within a slab window [@Brocher1999; @Erkan2008]. Both of
these features can be explained by the Cretaceous underplating of mantle
lithosphere and subsequent heating at depth by the slab window, in a manner
more consistent with the tectonic evolution of central California. Based on the
wide spectrum of geologic and geodynamic factors discussed above, we reject the
stalled slab as a potential mechanism for underplating of the mantle
lithosphere beneath Crystal Knob.

## Thermal events recorded by xenolith petrology

Petrologic markers within the Crystal Knob xenolith suite and the late
timing of the Crystal Knob eruption can be related to interaction of
the lithospheric lid from which the xenoliths were sourced with an
underlying deep slab window.
The Crystal Knob xenolith suite shows petrologic variation consistent
with reheating from below.  As discussed in @sec:PT-geochemical-variation,
the array of increasing depletion with depth in the Crystal Knob sample
set does not match simple decompression melting, and sample CK-6
experienced polyphase major-element refertilization by fractionated
melt presumably generated below its pre-eruptive depth. At the same time,
low levels of re-enrichment by alkali-basalt-like melt are evident across
the sample set. Deep partial melting and alkalic melt generation are common
features of slab window volcanism [@Hole1991] and may contribute to the
signature of deep depletion and re-enrichment seen in the Crystal Knob sample set.

The sourcing of the Crystal Knob pipe from
relatively deep levels of the mantle lithosphere, the highly
fractionated, alkalic magma, and the
presence of both dunite cumulates and peridotite xenoliths suggest that
the magma was sourced from a complex multi-tiered melt percolation
network within the mantle lithosphere at depths >45 km, such as the
fractal scaling of melt migration channels
investigated by @Kelemen2000. These host cumulates which are sometimes re-entrained
by small-volume volcanism, during a process of progressive upwards
percolation of melt from a deep mantle source.

A long-duration reservoir of slab window material locally rising through a thick lid of
relict mantle lithosphere may explain both mid-Miocene hypabyssal intrusives
that are directly related to the slab window episode, such as the Morro Rock--Islay Hills complex [@Stanley2000]
and Cambria Felsite [@Ernst1974], and later deeply-sourced, small-volume eruptions such as Crystal Knob.

## The Crystal Knob eruptive event {#sec:crystal_knob_eruption}

The time lag between deep slab window opening and the ca. 1.7
Ma eruptive age of Crystal Knob underscores the unknown genesis of the
Crystal Knob lava.
Our studies of the Crystal Knob xenoliths indicate an
underlying lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at a depth of 70-90 km,
consistent with regional seismic studies placing it at ~70 km
beneath the central California Coast Ranges [@Li2007]. In
contrast, 28-20 Ma oceanic lithosphere of the adjacent Monterey plate
[@Wilson2005], would have its lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at ~35 km,
based on thermal decay relations [@Doin1996].
The offshore Monterey plate is at the edge of the
resolution of @Li2007, who calculate a ~50 km depth for the
lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.  Proximal to the modern shoreline,
the Monterey plate is thrust beneath ~12 km of sedimentary accretionary
prism [@Trehu1991], bringing the theoretical thermal maturation depth
for the transition much closer to the depth observed by @Li2007.
Crystal Knob is located ~15 km east of the Hosgri fault, with its host
Franciscan complex pervasively cut by faults and shear zones
[@Cowan1978; @Seiders1989]. The geologic slip and seismicity history of the
Hosgri fault [@Dickinson2005; @Hardebeck2010] <!--could also refer to
Hardebeck2012--> indicate that it
was likely active during the eruption of the Crystal Knob neck.
Integration of theoretical and observational data on intra-continental
transform faults [@Platt2011; @Titus2007] indicate
that, at lower crustal--upper mantle levels, Hosgri fault shear could be
distributed across 10s of kilometers normal to the fault surface
[@fig:neogene_sections].
Eruption of small-volume basalts of Plio-Pleistocene age occurred
elsewhere in the Coast Range belt. This includes
the Coyote Lake pipe [@fig:context], which occurred ~150 km north
of Crystal Knob along the San Andreas-Calaveras fault bifurcation
zone and entrained lower crust and upper mantle xenoliths [@Jove1998; @Titus2007].
Xenoliths recovered
from these flows record asthenosphere ascent and partial melting
markedly post-dating any possible slab window opening. Thus, the
Crystal Knob small volume eruption is not an exceptional event.

Distributed shearing and strike-slip juxtaposition of the shallow
sub-Monterey plate asthenosphere against underplated Farallon plate
lithosphere and its deep slab window asthenosphere along the Hosgri
fault [@fig:neogene_sections|c] is a plausible mechanism for Crystal Knob basalt melt
generation. This was perhaps accentuated by possible extensional
transients along the fault surface as documented for the Coyote Lake
basalts [@Jove1998; @Titus2007]. Thermal modeling
presented above indicates that underplated Farallon mantle was already
re-heated by the deeper Neogene slab window. The abundance of dunite
cumulate xenoliths and xenocrysts in the Crystal Knob basalt suggests the generation
of significant melt in the mantle lithosphere beneath the Coast Ranges, and the
entrainment of peridotite xenoliths underscores its rapid ascent at ~1.65 Ma.
Two of the principal thermal maxima in the Coast Range thermal anomaly occur
in the areas of the Crystal Knob and Coyote Lake Plio-Pleistocene
basaltic eruptions [@Erkan2008, Figure 1], further
suggesting recent mobilization of asthenospheric mantle that was
initially emplaced into the early Neogene slab window, due to
extension in the mantle lithosphere.

Conclusion
==========

The lithospheric structure of southern California, to first order created by
Cretaceous convergent margin tectonics, was severely
overprinted by two subsequent tectonic episodes, with the impact and
subduction of the Shatsky Rise large igneous province conjugate during
the Late Cretaceous and the progressive evolution of a transform
boundary in the Neogene. These episodes are recorded throughout the
crustal geologic record of southern California and the central
California Coast Ranges outboard of the San Andreas Fault. Using
constraints from the Crystal Knob xenolith suite along with thermal
modeling of tectonic scenarios, we show that the mantle lithosphere
beneath the central California coast was profoundly affected by both of
these episodes of deformation. The Crystal Knob suite is sourced along a
depth gradient from ~45-70 km depth, and isotopic constraints show that
it originates from the convecting mantle, which is typical of mid-ocean
ridges or shallowly-ascended asthenosphere. Samples are variably
depleted, and trace-element re-enrichment (and a single example of
likely major-element assimilation) suggests interaction with low-volume
melts after the formation and initial thermal equilibration of this
mantle lithosphere material.

Major element, trace element, and radiogenic isotope data for the
Crystal Knob xenolith suite equally satisfy the first-order geochemical
requisites of the shallow slab window, stalled slab, and Late Cretaceous
mantle nappe tectonic scenarios. Xenolith pressure-temperature
constraints, thermal modeling, and geochemical subtleties of depletion
and re-enrichment together add some discriminating factors between these
scenarios. A shallowly underplated slab window predicts extremely hot
geotherms that are untenable for the xenolith constraints of this study.
The stalled slab and mantle nappe scenarios appear equally plausible in
terms of the thermal modeling, equally satisfying constraints developed
from xenolith thermobarometry. When the effects of potential
exhumation/erosion are qualitatively considered, the Monterey plate
stalled slab endmember scenario corresponds less well to constraints on
the upper-mantle geotherm. This, along with a number of crustal
geologic considerations, leads us to favor the Late Cretaceous mantle nappe
underplating scenario, with reheating by a deep slab window in the
Neogene.

This preferred scenario for the origin of the mantle lithosphere sampled
by Crystal Knob xenoliths matches a host of geologic constraints
demonstrating slab rollback and regional crustal extension during the
Late Cretaceous, as the Shatsky Rise conjugate subducted deeper into the
mantle following its initial collision and shallow subduction beneath
the southern California convergent margin. This episode built the
mantle lithosphere beneath the Mojave province by mantle duplexing
during the retreat of the Farallon Plate subducting slab [@Luffi2009],
and appears to have subsequently built the outboard mantle lithosphere beneath the
Crystal Knob eruption site. The outer toe of this lithosphere-scale
accretionary belt was subsequently displaced along the San Andreas
transform system to its current location beneath the central California
Coast Ranges. This displaced package of underplated mantle lithosphere
records basal reheating by the Mendocino slab
window, which opened in conjunction with the San Andreas plate juncture.
Peridotite major- and trace-element re-enrichment and abundant dunite cumulate xenoliths and
xenocrysts within the Crystal Knob basalt record the percolation of
fluids and melts through the lithosphere. This percolation, the highly
fractionated Crystal Knob basaltic pipe, and the modeled Neogene thermal
pulse that reheated the lithosphere can be attributed to a deep slab
window segment that opened as the Pacific--Farallon ridge encountered
the California convergent margin. This adds to a growing body of
evidence that much of the structural complexity in the California Coast
Ranges is inherited from the Late Cretaceous regime of subduction
accretion.
