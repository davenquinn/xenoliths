# Discussion of lithospheric history

In this section we integrate the results of thermal modeling with
petrogenetic findings on the Crystal Knob xenoliths, regional crustal structure
and evolution, and the timing and location of xenolith entrainment. Of the
three plausible scenarios depicted for the evolution of the sub-Crystal Knob
mantle lithosphere in @fig:neogene_sections, we reject the scenario of
asthenosphere emplaced in a shallow slab window, which predicts temperatures
much hotter than realistic and xenolith-sampled lithospheric geotherms.

Both Monterey plate stalled slab and Cretaceous-underplated Farallon mantle
nappe cases are plausible based on our thermal modeling. However, the geotherm
predicted for the Monterey Plate stalled slab occupies the higher-temperature
part of the acceptable field, and its viability may be affected by erosion in
the Coast Ranges, which would tend to elevate geotherms for all cases.

In rejecting a shallow asthenospheric slab window and finding an underplated
stalled slab within acceptable bounds, our model results match those previously
described in @Erkan2008. However, our scenario **C** has not been previously
tested, also predicts reasonable geotherms for the mantle lithosphere. In
contrast to the stalled-slab model, it is based on a wide literature of crustal
geology.

## Geologic and geodynamic shortcomings of the Neogene stalled slab

Based on the wide spectrum of geologic and geodynamic factors discussed above,
we dismiss the notion suggested by @Pikser2012 of a regionally extensive
Monterey Plate "dangling slab" extending far to the east of the San Andreas
fault.

### Transrotation

In the @fig:reconstruction reconstruction, the future Crystal Knob eruption
site sits above the Pacific-Farallon slab window ~50-100 km north of the
northeast margin of the partially subducted Monterey plate. The narrow slab
window segment shown along the eastern edge of the partially subducted plate
marks the plate’s separation locus with the Farallon plate, which subsequently
opened wider beneath the southern California region as the Farallon plate
descended deeper into the mantle [@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005]. Over the time
interval of ca. 22-10 Ma, the Monterey plate’s dextral motion relative to the
subducting trench had a nontrivial divergence component, due to its coupling to
the Pacific plate. Potential extensional attenuation of the underthrust portion
of the Monterey plate during such divergent motion is strongly implied in the
@Bohannon1995 reconstruction, though not explicitly explored. Coupling of
Monterey plate divergent motion across the subduction megathrust break is
hypothesized to have driven dextral transrotational rifting [@Bohannon1995].

As western Transverse Range crustal panels rotated into their current
position during
transrotational rifting, the Monterey plate continued its northward
displacement along the San Gregorio-Hosgri fault system [@fig:context]. Note
that in @fig:neogene_sections the outer edge of the Farallon-Monterey slab window is
on trend with the San Gregorio-Hosgri fault system [@Dickinson2005]. Distinct steps and
inflections in lower crustal velocity structure across this fault system
[@Brocher1999] indicates that it cuts the entire crust. This
poses the likely possibility that the San Gregorio-Hosgri fault system
bounds the eastern margin of underplated Monterey plate in the coastal
central California region. This is in line with seismic observations
showing an ~16º eastward-dipping Monterey plate offshore, with a typical
abyssal crustal thickness, juxtaposed against a nearly flat thickened
lower crustal layer beneath the Nacimiento Franciscan  [@Trehu1991; @Nicholson1992].
These observations are in direct conflict with the notion that
a structurally continuous mafic layer constitutes the
lower crust beneath the central coastal California and adjacent offshore
region.

#### Horizontal translation

Studies proposing a deep Monterey plate "dangling slab" [e.g. @Furlong1989; @Pikser2012]
have suggested that translation of the Monterey plate along the San Andreas system entailed significant
sub-horizontal fault segments that accommodated dextral displacements
[@fig:neogene_sections|c]. As of yet, however, all seismically imaged
segments of the transform system have been shown to be
steeply oriented [@Dietz1990; @Brocher1999; @Yan2005; @Titus2007; @Yan2007; @Ozacar2009].

This assertion is generally paired with the discussion of a structurally continuous mafic layer,
which represents the stalled Monterey plate and constitutes the lower crust
beneath the entire coastal central California and offshore region.
These studies further suggest that the Monterey "dangling slab"
currently corresponds to the high-wave speed anomaly of the southern
Sierra Nevada-Great Valley region [@fig:context], commonly called the
“Isabella anomaly”.

Seismological and geodynamic studies
show that the Isabella anomaly is derived primarily from the convectively
mobilized mantle wedge, or mantle lithosphere of the southern Sierra Nevada batholith
[@Zandt2004; @Frassetto2011; @Gilbert2012; @Saleeby2012; @Jones2014; @Levandowski2015].
In addition to showing structural continuity between the seismic
anomaly and the residual mantle lithosphere that is still in place
beneath the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada [@fig:context], these studies show
that the volume of the Isabella anomaly far exceeds reasonable volume
estimates for the attenuated terminus of a hypothetical translated
Monterey slab. These studies also provide mechanisms for lower crustal
plastic deformation, observable surface faulting, upper mantle--lower
crustal partial melting and dynamic topographic effects that are all ignored
in the dangling slab hypothesis.

First-order geological effects such as volcanism and
topographic transients are closely correlated to the
convective mobilization of the sub-Sierran mantle lithosphere,
and its current expression as the Isabella anomaly
[@Ducea1998b; @Farmer2002; @Saleeby2013; @Cecil2014; @Levandowski2015].
The surface effects of Monterey plate partial subduction followed by transtensional coupling to Pacific
plate motions are closely correlated to transrotational rifting in the
southern California Borderland and the linked clockwise rotation of
western Transverse Ranges bedrock panels [@Bohannon1995; @Wilson2005].
This is in line with the Monterey slab’s limited down-dip extent as bounded by the Monterey-Farallon slab window
segment shown in @fig:reconstruction. If the hypothetical Monterey "dangling slab"
were of proper proportion to form the Isabella anomaly, then why were
its effects on surface geology restricted to the Borderland and
Transverse Ranges? Epeirogenic transients that correlate to the
convective mobilization of the sub-Sierran mantle lithosphere as the
Isabella anomaly are highly out of phase with the predicted translation
pattern for a “dangling” Monterey slab [@Saleeby2013; @Cecil2014].
Possible remnants of necked off partially subducted Monterey plate are more plausibly correlated to the Transverse Ranges high-wave
speed anomaly in terms of position and volume [@fig:context], and also have a
firm geodynamic basis as such [@Burkett2009].


#### Structurally continuous mafic layer

Seismic data cited in support of the stalled slab hypothesis consist of
an 8-15 km thick, shallowly east-dipping mafic lower crustal layer that extends
beneath central California from the offshore region into proximity of
the San Andreas fault, thickening eastwards over Moho depths
of ~12-30 km [@Brocher1999]. Strong internal reflectivity within this layer
[@Trehu1987; @Brocher1999], and sharp
inflections in its upper surface [@Trehu1991], indicate that this mafic
layer is internally deformed and imbricated, which accounts for its
thickness exceeding typical oceanic mafic crust by a factor of two to three.

This seismic data shows that the crustal section attributed to the Neogene
stalled slab is imbricated along the toe of the mafic duplex in the offshore
region. Such imbrication and underplating require a basal detachment, which is
most logically located at the underlying Moho. In this context, the regions’s
lower crustal mafic layer is more plausibly interpreted as a regional
underplated duplex of Farallon plate oceanic crustal nappes that accreted
during Franciscan subduction.


Much of the attractiveness of the stalled slab hypothesis
lies in its utility to explain sparse Neogene volcanism in the Coast
Ranges as well as modern heat flow values that are too low to be
explained by shallow underplated asthenosphere emplaced within a slab
window.
@Erkan2008 examined whether the migrating slab window caused wholesale replacement of underlying
mantle lithosphere against a possible "stalled slab", and concluded that
the stalled slab was more likely due to the lower thermal gradients and
heat flows predicted by this mechanism. Though their model techniques were
sound, they failed to consider another distinct tectonic mechanism that
could result in similarly lower thermal gradients than a shallow slab
window. We summarize this mechanism and the supporting geologic data
below.

Depending on the original scale of the subducted portion of the Monterey Plate
beneath the southern California borderland [@fig:neogene_sections], its structural
integrity following its coupling to borderland transrotational rifting,
and the potential correspondence of the partially subducted plate
to the detached portion that forms the Transverse Ranges
high-wave speed anomaly [@fig:context], an argument could be made that an
underthrust portion of the Monterey Plate has been translated northwards
horizontally beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site
[@fig:neogene_sections|b]. Although
kinematically plausible, in theory, this case seems unlikely based on
dynamic factors. As with the "dangling slab" version of this case,
horizontal translation of such a large mantle mass along the base of the
crust should manifest at the surface by transients in dynamic
topography, as well as brittle crustal deformation in response to
horizontal shear stresses in the lower crust. Such surface deformation
patterns are not expressed north of the Transverse Ranges in late Cenozoic time.
Furthermore, horizontal translation of a
previously underthrust slab provides no melting mechanism
for the early Neogene or Pleistocene volcanic centers of the region. We
thus conclude that, despite the inability the Crystal Knob xenolith
suite to fully rule it out, an eastward-extending stalled Monterey plate
is geologically and geodynamically untenable.


@fig:neogene_sections|c shows our preferred we show the partially subducted
terminus of the Monterey plate bounded to the east by the San Gregorio-Hosgri
fault, based on our above discussion of the @fig:reconstruction reconstruction.
East of the fault lies the Nacimiento Franciscan complex and its tectonic
veneer of Salinia nappes (not differentiated on the figure), and its lower
crustal oceanic crustal duplex lying tectonically above underplated
Farallon-plate mantle nappes. The structural profile shown on
@fig:neogene_sections|c between the San Andreas and San Gregorio-Hosgri faults
was constructed at southern California latitudes in continuity with that of the
southernmost Sierra Nevada and adjacent Mojave plateau region
[@fig:reconstruction; @fig:cross_sections]. Partial subduction, or stalling, of
the Monterey plate occurred along the outer edge of Franciscan complex, further
south than rocks of the Nacimiento belt [@fig:reconstruction].

## Thermal events recorded by xenolith petrology

Petrologic markers within the Crystal Knob xenolith suite and the late
timing of the Crystal Knob eruption can be related to interaction of
the lithospheric lid from which the xenoliths were sourced with an
underlying deep slab window.
The Crystal Knob xenolith suite shows petrologic variation consistent
with reheating from below.  As discussed in @sec:PT-geochemical-variation,
the array of increasing depletion with depth in the Crystal Knob sample
set does not match simple decompression melting, and sample CK-6
experienced polyphase major-element refertilization by fractionated
melt presumably generated below its pre-eruptive depth. At the same time,
low levels of re-enrichment by alkali-basalt-like melt are evident across
the sample set. Deep partial melting and alkalic melt generation are common
features of slab window volcanism [@Hole1991] and may contribute to the
signature of deep depletion and re-enrichment seen in the Crystal Knob sample set.

The sourcing of the Crystal Knob pipe from
relatively deep levels of the mantle lithosphere, the highly
fractionated, alkalic magma, and the
presence of both dunite cumulates and peridotite xenoliths suggest that
the magma was sourced from a complex multi-tiered melt percolation
network within the mantle lithosphere at depths >45 km, such as the
fractal scaling of melt migration channels
investigated by @Kelemen2000. These host cumulates which are sometimes re-entrained
by small-volume volcanism, during a process of progressive upwards
percolation of melt from a deep mantle source.

A long-duration reservoir of slab window material locally rising through a thick lid of
relict mantle lithosphere may explain both mid-Miocene hypabyssal intrusives
that are directly related to the slab window episode, such as the Morro Rock--Islay Hills complex [@Stanley2000]
and Cambria Felsite [@Ernst1974], and later deeply-sourced, small-volume eruptions such as Crystal Knob.

## The Crystal Knob eruptive event {#sec:crystal_knob_eruption}

The time lag between deep slab window opening and the ca. 1.7
Ma eruptive age of Crystal Knob underscores the unknown genesis of the
Crystal Knob lava.
Our studies of the Crystal Knob xenoliths indicate an
underlying lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at a depth of 70-90 km,
consistent with regional seismic studies placing it at ~70 km
beneath the central California Coast Ranges [@Li2007]. In
contrast, 28-20 Ma oceanic lithosphere of the adjacent Monterey plate
[@Wilson2005], would have its lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at ~35 km,
based on thermal decay relations [@Doin1996].
The offshore Monterey plate is at the edge of the
resolution of @Li2007, who calculate a ~50 km depth for the
lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.  Proximal to the modern shoreline,
the Monterey plate is thrust beneath ~12 km of sedimentary accretionary
prism [@Trehu1991], bringing the theoretical thermal maturation depth
for the transition much closer to the depth observed by @Li2007.
Crystal Knob is located ~15 km east of the Hosgri fault, with its host
Franciscan complex pervasively cut by faults and shear zones
[@Cowan1978; @Seiders1989]. The geologic slip and seismicity history of the
Hosgri fault [@Dickinson2005; @Hardebeck2010] <!--could also refer to
Hardebeck2012--> indicate that it
was likely active during the eruption of the Crystal Knob neck.
Integration of theoretical and observational data on intra-continental
transform faults [@Platt2011; @Titus2007] indicate
that, at lower crustal--upper mantle levels, Hosgri fault shear could be
distributed across 10s of kilometers normal to the fault surface
[@fig:neogene_sections].
Eruption of small-volume basalts of Plio-Pleistocene age occurred
elsewhere in the Coast Range belt. This includes
the Coyote Lake pipe [@fig:context], which occurred ~150 km north
of Crystal Knob along the San Andreas-Calaveras fault bifurcation
zone and entrained lower crust and upper mantle xenoliths [@Jove1998; @Titus2007].
Xenoliths recovered
from these flows record asthenosphere ascent and partial melting
markedly post-dating any possible slab window opening. Thus, the
Crystal Knob small volume eruption is not an exceptional event.

Distributed shearing and strike-slip juxtaposition of the shallow
sub-Monterey plate asthenosphere against underplated Farallon plate
lithosphere and its deep slab window asthenosphere along the Hosgri
fault [@fig:neogene_sections|c] is a plausible mechanism for Crystal Knob basalt melt
generation. This was perhaps accentuated by possible extensional
transients along the fault surface as documented for the Coyote Lake
basalts [@Jove1998; @Titus2007]. Thermal modeling
presented above indicates that underplated Farallon mantle was already
re-heated by the deeper Neogene slab window. The abundance of dunite
cumulate xenoliths and xenocrysts in the Crystal Knob basalt suggests the generation
of significant melt in the mantle lithosphere beneath the Coast Ranges, and the
entrainment of peridotite xenoliths underscores its rapid ascent at ~1.65 Ma.
Two of the principal thermal maxima in the Coast Range thermal anomaly occur
in the areas of the Crystal Knob and Coyote Lake Plio-Pleistocene
basaltic eruptions [@Erkan2008, Figure 1], further
suggesting recent mobilization of asthenospheric mantle that was
initially emplaced into the early Neogene slab window, due to
extension in the mantle lithosphere.

Conclusion
==========

The lithospheric structure of southern California, to first order created by
Cretaceous convergent margin tectonics, was severely
overprinted by two subsequent tectonic episodes, with the impact and
subduction of the Shatsky Rise large igneous province conjugate during
the Late Cretaceous and the progressive evolution of a transform
boundary in the Neogene. These episodes are recorded throughout the
crustal geologic record of southern California and the central
California Coast Ranges outboard of the San Andreas Fault. Using
constraints from the Crystal Knob xenolith suite along with thermal
modeling of tectonic scenarios, we show that the mantle lithosphere
beneath the central California coast was profoundly affected by both of
these episodes of deformation. The Crystal Knob suite is sourced along a
depth gradient from ~45-70 km depth, and isotopic constraints show that
it originates from the convecting mantle, which is typical of mid-ocean
ridges or shallowly-ascended asthenosphere. Samples are variably
depleted, and trace-element re-enrichment (and a single example of
likely major-element assimilation) suggests interaction with low-volume
melts after the formation and initial thermal equilibration of this
mantle lithosphere material.

Major element, trace element, and radiogenic isotope data for the
Crystal Knob xenolith suite equally satisfy the first-order geochemical
requisites of the shallow slab window, stalled slab, and Late Cretaceous
mantle nappe tectonic scenarios. Xenolith pressure-temperature
constraints, thermal modeling, and geochemical subtleties of depletion
and re-enrichment together add some discriminating factors between these
scenarios. A shallowly underplated slab window predicts extremely hot
geotherms that are untenable for the xenolith constraints of this study.
The stalled slab and mantle nappe scenarios appear equally plausible in
terms of the thermal modeling, equally satisfying constraints developed
from xenolith thermobarometry. When the effects of potential
exhumation/erosion are qualitatively considered, the Monterey plate
stalled slab endmember scenario corresponds less well to constraints on
the upper-mantle geotherm. This, along with a number of crustal
geologic considerations, leads us to favor the Late Cretaceous mantle nappe
underplating scenario, with reheating by a deep slab window in the
Neogene.

This preferred scenario for the origin of the mantle lithosphere sampled
by Crystal Knob xenoliths matches a host of geologic constraints
demonstrating slab rollback and regional crustal extension during the
Late Cretaceous, as the Shatsky Rise conjugate subducted deeper into the
mantle following its initial collision and shallow subduction beneath
the southern California convergent margin. This episode built the
mantle lithosphere beneath the Mojave province by mantle duplexing
during the retreat of the Farallon Plate subducting slab [@Luffi2009],
and appears to have subsequently built the outboard mantle lithosphere beneath the
Crystal Knob eruption site. The outer toe of this lithosphere-scale
accretionary belt was subsequently displaced along the San Andreas
transform system to its current location beneath the central California
Coast Ranges. This displaced package of underplated mantle lithosphere
records basal reheating by the Mendocino slab
window, which opened in conjunction with the San Andreas plate juncture.
Peridotite major- and trace-element re-enrichment and abundant dunite cumulate xenoliths and
xenocrysts within the Crystal Knob basalt record the percolation of
fluids and melts through the lithosphere. This percolation, the highly
fractionated Crystal Knob basaltic pipe, and the modeled Neogene thermal
pulse that reheated the lithosphere can be attributed to a deep slab
window segment that opened as the Pacific--Farallon ridge encountered
the California convergent margin. This adds to a growing body of
evidence that much of the structural complexity in the California Coast
Ranges is inherited from the Late Cretaceous regime of subduction
accretion.
