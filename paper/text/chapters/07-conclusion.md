# Contemporary lithospheric structure and thermal state

In this section we integrate the results of our thermal modeling with our
petrogenetic findings on the Crystal Knob xenoliths, regional crustal structure
and evolution, and the timing and location of xenolith entrainment. Of the
three plausible scenarios depicted for the evolution of the sub-Crystal Knob
mantle lithosphere in @fig:neogene_sections, we reject the scenario of
asthenosphere emplaced in a shallow slab window,
based on our thermal modeling presented above. The
Monterey plate stalled slab and underplated Farallon plate mantle nappe cases
are equally plausible based on our thermal modeling. Based on the wide spectrum
of geologic and geodynamic factors discussed above, we dismiss the
notion suggested by @Pikser2012 of a regionally extensive Monterey Plate
"dangling slab" extending far to the east of the San Andreas fault.

Depending on the original scale of the subducted portion of the Monterey Plate
beneath the southern California borderland [@fig:neogene_sections], its structural
integrity following its coupling to borderland transrotational rifting,
and the potential correspondence of the partially subducted plate
to the detached portion that forms the Transverse Ranges
high-wave speed anomaly [@fig:context], an argument could be made that an
underthrust portion of the Monterey Plate has been translated northwards
horizontally beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site
[@fig:neogene_sections|b]. Although
kinematically plausible, in theory, this case seems unlikely based on
dynamic factors. As with the "dangling slab" version of this case,
horizontal translation of such a large mantle mass along the base of the
crust should manifest at the surface by transients in dynamic
topography, as well as brittle crustal deformation in response to
horizontal shear stresses in the lower crust. Such surface deformation
patterns are not expressed north of the Transverse Ranges in late Cenozoic time.
Furthermore, horizontal translation of a
previously underthrust slab provides no melting mechanism
for the early Neogene or Pleistocene volcanic centers of the region. We
thus conclude that despite of our findings on the Crystal Knob xenolith
suite not being able to discriminate between the stalled Monterey plate,
or underplated Farallon nappe cases, the stalled Monterey plate case
creates more problems than it solves.

In @fig:neogene_sections|c we show the partially subducted terminus of the Monterey
plate bounded to the east by the San Gregorio-Hosgri fault, based on our
above discussion of the @fig:reconstruction reconstruction. East of the fault lies
the Nacimiento Franciscan complex and its tectonic veneer of Salinia
nappes (not differentiated on the figure), and its lower crustal oceanic
crustal duplex lying tectonically above an underplated Farallon plate mantle
nappes. The structural profile shown on @fig:neogene_sections|c between the San
Andreas and San Gregorio-Hosgri faults was constructed at southern
California latitudes in continuity with that of the southernmost Sierra
Nevada and adjacent Mojave plateau region [@fig:reconstruction; @fig:cross_sections]. Partial
subduction, or stalling, of the Monterey plate occurred along the outer
edge of Franciscan complex, further south than rocks of the Nacimiento
belt [@fig:reconstruction].

Slab window opening beneath the Crystal Knob eruption site is
reconstructed to have occurred between ca. 28-23 Ma [@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005].
As posited above, a thick and relatively cool lithospheric lid
inhibited widespread voluminous volcanism in response to asthenospheric
upwelling during the opening of the slab window.
Petrologic markers within the Crystal Knob xenolith suite and the late
timing of the Crystal Knob eruption can be related to interaction of
the lithospheric lid from which the xenoliths were sourced, with an
underlying deep slab window [@fig:neogene_sections|c].

## Implications of petrologic complexities to thermal state

The Crystal Knob xenolith suite shows petrologic variation consistent
with reheating from below.  As discussed in @sec:temperature-significance,
the LREE disequilibrium seen in
several samples (especially CK-4) could be the signature of a fossil heating
event not fully re-equilibrated in LREEs. This is underscored by the presence
of melt-infiltration textures in sample CK-4. The apparent polyphase
major-element refertilization in sample CK-6 as well as the apparently
re-enriched clinopyroxenes across the sample set attest to the assimilation of
varying amounts of material after the initial equilibration of these
xenoliths, and re-equilibration of major-element compositions after this event.

The sourcing of the Crystal Knob pipe from
relatively deep levels of the mantle lithosphere, the highly
fractionated nature of the magma with zoned phenocrysts, and the
presence of both dunite cumulates and peridotite xenoliths suggest that
the magma was sourced from a complex multi-tiered melt percolation
network within the mantle lithosphere at depths >50 km, such as that
investigated by @Kelemen2000, which includes fractal scaling of melt
migration channels hosting cumulates, which are sometimes re-entrained
by small-volume volcanism. Such a network is linked to progressive
percolation of melt upwards from a deep mantle source.

A long-duration reservoir of slab window material locally rising through a thick lid of
relict mantle lithosphere may explain both mid-Miocene hypabyssal intrusives
that are directly related to the slab window episode
(e.g. the Morro Rock--Islay Hills complex [@Stanley2000]
and the Cambria Felsite [@Ernst1974]) and later deeply
sourced small-volume eruptions such as Crystal Knob.

## Origin of the Crystal Knob basalt {#sec:crystal_knob_eruption}

The time lag between deep slab window opening and the ca. 1.7
Ma eruptive age of Crystal Knob presents a problem for the origin of the
Crystal Knob lava. Our studies on the Crystal Knob xenoliths indicate an
underlying lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at a depth of 70-90 km,
consistent with regional seismic studies placing it at ~70 km
beneath the central California Coast Ranges [@Li2007]. In
contrast, 28-20 Ma old oceanic lithosphere of the adjacent Monterey plate
[@Wilson2005], would have its lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at ~35 km,
based on thermal decay relations [@Doin1996].
The offshore Monterey plate is at the edge of the
resolution of @Li2007, which yields an ~50 km depth for the
lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.  Proximal to the modern shoreline
the Monterey plate is thrust beneath ~12 km of sedimentary accretionary
prism [@Trehu1991], bringing the theoretical thermal maturation depth
for the transition much closer to the depth observed by @Li2007.
Crystal Knob is located ~15 km east of the Hosgri fault, with its host
Franciscan complex pervasively cut by faults and shear zones
[@Cowan1978; @Seiders1989]. The geologic slip and seismicity history of the
Hosgri fault [@Dickinson2005; @Hardebeck2010] <!--could also refer to
Hardebeck2012--> indicate that it
was likely active during the eruption of the Crystal Knob neck.
Integration of theoretical and observational data on intra-continental
transform faults [@Platt2011; @Titus2007] indicate
that at lower crustal--upper mantle levels Hosgri fault shear could be
distributed across 10s of kilometers normal to the fault surface
[@fig:neogene_sections].
Eruption of small-volume basaltic flows of Plio-Pleistocene age occurred
elsewhere in the Coast Range belt. This includes
the Coyote Lake pipe [@fig:context], which occurred ~150 km north
of Crystal Knob along the San Andreas-Calaveras fault bifurcation
zone and entrained lower crust and upper mantle xenoliths [@Jove1998; @Titus2007].
Xenoliths recovered
from these flows record asthenosphere ascent and partial melting that
markedly post-dates any possible slab window opening, and thus the
Crystal Knob small volume eruption is not an exceptional event.

Distributed shearing and strike-slip juxtaposition of the shallow
sub-Monterey plate asthenosphere against underplated Farallon plate
lithosphere and its deep slab window asthenosphere along the Hosgri
fault [@fig:neogene_sections|c] is a plausible mechanism for Crystal Knob basalt melt
generation. This was perhaps accentuated by possible extensional
transients along the fault surface as documented for the Coyote Lake
basalts [@Jove1998; @Titus2007]. Thermal modeling
presented above indicates that underplated Farallon mantle was already
re-heated by the deeper Neogene slab window. The abundance of dunite
cumulate xenoliths and xenocrysts in the Crystal Knob basalt suggests the generation
of significant melt in the mantle lithosphere beneath the Coast Ranges, and the
entrainment of peridotite xenoliths underscores its rapid ascent at ca. 1.7 Ma.
Two of the principal thermal maxima in the Coast Range thermal anomaly occur
in the areas of the Crystal Knob and Coyote Lake Plio-Pleistocene
basaltic eruptions [@Erkan2008, Figure 1], further
suggesting recent mobilization of asthenospheric mantle that was
initially emplaced into the early Neogene slab window, due to
extension in the mantle lithosphere.

Conclusion
==========

The lithospheric structure of southern California, to first order created by
Cretaceous convergent margin tectonics, was severely
overprinted by two subsequent tectonic episodes, with the impact and
subduction of the Shatsky Rise large igneous province conjugate during
the Late Cretaceous followed by the progressive evolution of a transform
boundary in the Neogene. These episodes are recorded throughout the
crustal geologic record of southern California and the central
California Coast Ranges outboard of the San Andreas Fault. Using
constraints from the Crystal Knob xenolith suite along with thermal
modeling of tectonic scenarios, we show that the mantle lithosphere
beneath the central California coast was profoundly affected by both of
these episodes of deformation. The Crystal Knob suite is sourced along a
depth gradient from ~45-70 km depth, and isotopic constraints show that
it originates from the convecting mantle, which is typical of mid-ocean
ridges or shallowly-ascended asthenosphere. Samples are variably
depleted, and trace-element re-enrichment (and a single example of
likely major-element assimilation) suggests interaction with low-volume
melts after the formation and initial thermal equilibration of this
mantle lithosphere material.

Major element, trace element, and radiogenic isotope data for the
Crystal Knob xenolith suite equally satisfy the first-order geochemical
requisites of the shallow slab window, stalled slab, and Late Cretaceous
mantle nappe tectonic scenarios. Xenolith pressure-temperature
constraints, thermal modeling, and geochemical subtleties of depletion
and re-enrichment together add some discriminating factors between these
scenarios. A shallowly underplated slab window predicts extremely hot
geotherms that are untenable for the xenolith constraints of this study.
The stalled slab and mantle nappe scenarios appear equally plausible in
terms of the thermal modeling, equally satisfying constraints developed
from xenolith thermobarometry. When the effects of potential
exhumation/erosion are qualitatively considered, the Monterey plate
stalled slab endmember scenario corresponds less well to constraints on
the upper-mantle geotherm. This, along with a number of crustal
geologic constraints, leads us to favor the Late Cretaceous mantle nappe
underplating scenario, with reheating by a deep slab window in the
Neogene.

This preferred scenario for the origin of the mantle lithosphere sampled
by Crystal Knob xenoliths matches a host of geologic constraints
demonstrating slab rollback and regional crustal extension during the
Late Cretaceous, as the Shatsky Rise conjugate subducted deeper into the
mantle following its initial collision and shallow subduction beneath
the southern California convergent margin. This episode built the
mantle lithosphere beneath the Mojave province by mantle duplexing
during the retreat of the Farallon Plate subducting slab [@Luffi2009],
and appears to have subsequently built the outboard mantle lithosphere beneath the
Crystal Knob eruption site. The outer toe of this lithosphere-scale
accretionary belt was subsequently displaced along the San Andreas
transform system to its current location beneath the central California
Coast Ranges. This displaced package of underplated mantle lithosphere
records basal reheating by the Mendocino slab
window, which opened in conjunction with the San Andreas plate juncture.
Geochemical re-enrichment and abundant dunite cumulate xenoliths and
xenocrysts within the Crystal Knob basalt record the percolation of
fluids and melts through the lithosphere. This percolation, the highly
fractionated Crystal Knob basaltic pipe, and the modeled Neogene thermal
pulse that reheated the lithosphere can be attributed to a deep slab
window segment that opened as the Pacific--Farallon ridge encountered
the California convergent margin. This adds to a growing body of
evidence that much of the structural complexity in the California Coast
Ranges is inherited from the Late Cretaceous regime of subduction
accretion.
