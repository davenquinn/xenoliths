# Discussion of lithospheric history

Based on thermal modeling alone, both the Monterey plate stalled slab (**B**)
and Cretaceous-underplated Farallon mantle nappe cases (**C**) are plausible.
However, the geotherm predicted for the stalled slab occupies the
higher-temperature part of the acceptable field, and its viability could be
impacted by potential erosion in the
Coast Ranges, which would elevate geotherms for all scenarios
[@fig:model_comparison]. Our finding that the stalled slab scenario produces
a reasonable geotherm is consistent with previous modeling by @Erkan2008.
Additionally, there are many geologic and geodynamic reasons to discount the
feasibility of the stalled slab model for lithospheric underplating, which we
detail in @sec:stalled-slab-bad below.

We strongly prefer scenario **C**, Cretaceous underplating of mantle
lithosphere followed by heating at depth by the Neogene slab window,
which was not considered in previous modeling. This scenario produces
reasonable geotherms in the mantle lithosphere [@fig:model_comparison]
and is constructed based on the architecture of the lithospheric mantle
in the Mojave region [@Luffi2009] and the crustal geologic structure of
southern California inherited from Cretaceous tectonics [e.g. @Liu2010;
@Chapman2012]. The modeled Neogene thermal pulse also aligns this
scenario with the Neogene geodynamics of coastal California
[@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005] and suggests an explanation for the lack of
large-volume magmatism associated with the Pacific--Farallon slab
window.

## Geodynamic implausibility of the Neogene stalled slab {#sec:stalled-slab-bad}

The Monterey plate nucleated along a ~250 km segment of the Pacific-Farallon
ridge as an oblique rift that was rotated ~25º clockwise from the
Pacific-Farallon rift axis [@Atwater1989]. Its generation was synchronous with
the early stages of Pacific-Farallon plate convergence into the Cordilleran
subduction zone along the southern California coastal region, and coincided
with transrotational rifting of the continental borderland region and
displacement of the western Transverse Ranges bedrock [@Bohannon1995;
@Atwater1998].

The current position of the Monterey plate offshore of the Crystal Knob
eruption site is a result of dextral displacements linked to borderland
transrotational rifting, subsequent ~155 km-scale dextral offsets along the San
Gregorio-Hosgri fault system, and ~100 km of additional dextral offsets in the
offshore region [@fig:context] as modeled both by geologic reconstruction of
fault offsets [@Dickinson2005] and plate kinematic reconstructions
[@Wilson2005]. Continuation of the Monterey plate east of the San
Gregorio-Hosgri fault requires the lateral translation of its downdip extension
along the former subduction interface beneath the Coast Ranges. Its
hypothetical extension east of the San Andreas fault requires that this
subduction interface likewise extended eastwards beyond the San Andreas fault
[e.g. @Brocher1999; @tenBrink1999; @Pikser2012]. Seismological, geodynamic, and
surface geological evidence presented here argues against models invoking
horizontal translation of the Monterey plate "remnant slab” beneath both the
Coast Ranges and Central Valley.

In the early Miocene, the future Crystal Knob eruption site sat above the Pacific-Farallon
slab window, ~50-100 km north of the northeast margin of the partially
subducted Monterey plate [@fig:reconstruction]. The microplate separated
from the Farallon Plate at ca. 22 Ma, forming a widening slab window segment
east of the Peninsular Ranges [@Atwater1998; @Wilson2005]. From ca. 22 to 10 Ma, the
Monterey plate, already coupled to the Pacific plate, diverged from
North America. This likely caused extensional attenuation of its subducted
extension [@Bohannon1995]. Coupling
of Monterey plate rotation across the stalled subduction megathrust
may have driven dextral transrotational rifting of the
southern California borderland [@Nicholson1994; @Bohannon1995].

As western Transverse Range crustal panels rotated to their current position at
the end of borderland transrotation (ca. 10 Ma), the Monterey plate was displaced
northward along the San Gregorio-Hosgri fault system [@fig:context], which is
aligned with the outer edge of the Farallon-Monterey slab window
[@fig:reconstruction]. In conjunction with the sudden cessation of crustal
transrotation, the Monterey Plate likely separated from its underthrust
extension.

If the subducted portion of the Monterey Plate maintained its structural
integrity following borderland transrotational rifting and was not cut by the
San Gregorio-Hosgri fault, it would be translated northward beneath the Coast
Ranges on a shallowly dipping fault surface (presumably, the remobilized
subduction megathrust) along with its Pacific-plate abyssal fragment
[@fig:neogene_sections|c]. This geometry has been proposed to
extend beneath the entire Coast Ranges and east of the San Andreas fault [e.g.
@tenBrink1999; @Pikser2012]. Although kinematically plausible, this
is unlikely based on dynamic factors: a large mantle mass at the base of the
crust should cause transients in dynamic topography and brittle crustal
deformation in response to coupling across the shallow fault. Such surface
deformation patterns are not expressed north of the Transverse Ranges during
the Neogene.

Seismic tomography of central California [@Trehu1987] suggests a 8-15 km
thick, shallowly east-dipping mafic lower crustal layer that extends
from the offshore region towards the San Andreas fault, thickening
eastwards over Moho depths of ~12-30 km. This layer could represents the
continuous surface of the stalled Monterey plate beneath coastal central
California [@Brocher1999]. However, strong internal reflectivity within
this mafic layer [@Trehu1987; @Brocher1999] and sharp inflections in its
upper surface [@Trehu1991] indicate that it is internally deformed and
imbricated. It is accordingly two to three times as thick as typical
mafic oceanic crust. Such imbrication and underplating require a basal
detachment, which is most logically located at the underlying Moho. In
this context, the regions’s lower-crustal mafic layer is more plausibly
interpreted as a regional underplated duplex of Farallon plate oceanic
crustal nappes that accreted during Franciscan subduction
[@fig:neogene_sections|c].

Distinct steps and inflections in lower-crustal velocity structure
across the San
Gregorio-Hosgri fault system [@Brocher1999] indicate that it cuts the entire
crust, likely forming the eastern boundary of the underplated Monterey plate.
Additionally, offshore seismic observations show a ~16º eastward-dipping
Monterey plate, with a typical abyssal crustal thickness, juxtaposed against
a nearly flat thickened lower crustal layer beneath the adjacent Franciscan
complex [@Trehu1991; @Nicholson1992]. These observations directly conflict with
the idea that a structurally continuous Monterey Plate constitutes the lower
crust beneath central coastal California and the adjacent offshore region.

Studies proposing a deep Monterey plate stalled slab [e.g. @Furlong1989;
@Pikser2012] have suggested its translation on significant sub-horizontal fault
segments beneath the San Andreas system that accommodated dextral
displacements. As of yet, however, all seismically imaged segments of the
transform system have been shown to be steeply oriented [@Dietz1990;
@Brocher1999; @Yan2005; @Titus2007; @Yan2007; @Ozacar2009]. These studies
typically propose a steeply dipping eastward extension corresponding to the
high-wave speed anomaly of the southern Sierra Nevada-Great Valley region
[@fig:context], commonly called the “Isabella anomaly”.

Seismological and geodynamic studies
show that the Isabella anomaly is derived primarily from the convectively
mobilized mantle wedge, or mantle lithosphere, of the southern Sierra Nevada
batholith [@Zandt2004; @Frassetto2011; @Gilbert2012; @Saleeby2012; @Jones2014;
@Levandowski2015]. These studies show structural continuity between the seismic
anomaly and the residual mantle lithosphere that is still in place beneath the
Central Valley and Sierra Nevada [@fig:context] and suggest that the 200
km--deep by 100 km--wide Isabella anomaly far exceeds the reasonable
size of an attenuated terminus of the Monterey Plate. These studies also provide
mechanisms for lower crustal plastic deformation, observable surface faulting,
upper mantle--lower crustal partial melting and dynamic topographic effects
that are ignored in the stalled-slab hypothesis.

First-order geological effects such as volcanism and
topographic transients are closely correlated to the convective mobilization of
the sub-Sierran mantle lithosphere and its current expression as the Isabella
anomaly [@Ducea1998b; @Farmer2002; @Saleeby2013; @Cecil2014; @Levandowski2015].
The surface effects of Monterey plate partial subduction, followed by
transtensional coupling to the Pacific plate, are closely correlated to
transrotational rifting in the southern California Borderland and the linked
clockwise rotation of the western Transverse Ranges [@Bohannon1995;
@Wilson2005]. This supports a Monterey slab with a limited down-dip extent,
bounded by the Monterey-Farallon slab window segment
[@fig:reconstruction]. If the hypothetical Monterey "relict slab" extended
far enough inland to form the Isabella anomaly, its effects on surface
geology should not be restricted to the Borderland and Transverse
Ranges. Epeirogenic
transients that correlate to the convective mobilization of the sub-Sierran
mantle lithosphere as the Isabella anomaly are highly out of phase with the
predicted translation pattern for a deep Monterey slab [@Saleeby2013;
@Cecil2014]. Possible remnants of necked-off, partially subducted Monterey
plate are more plausibly correlated to the Transverse Ranges high-wave speed
anomaly in terms of position and volume [@fig:context], and also have a firm
geodynamic basis as such [@Burkett2009].

The stalled slab hypothesis has provided an explanation for the limited Neogene
volcanism and low modern crustal heat flow observed in the Coast Ranges, neither of
which can correspond the shallow emplacement of asthenosphere within
a slab window [@Brocher1999; @Erkan2008]. These observations can also be
explained by the formation of the slab window beneath a thick
pre-existing mantle lithosphere attached to the continental margin.
The underplated of such a domain during the Cretaceous is consistent
with the tectonic evolution of southern California. Based on the
geologic and geodynamic factors discussed above, we reject the stalled slab as
a potential mechanism for underplating the mantle lithosphere beneath
the central Coast Ranges.

## Thermal events recorded by xenolith petrology

The Crystal Knob xenolith suite shows petrologic variation consistent with
reheating from below, possibly due to interaction of a deep slab window with
a thick pre-existing lithospheric lid from which the xenoliths were
sourced. Increasing depletion
with depth in the Crystal Knob sample
set does not match the signature of simple decompression
melting [@sec:PT-geochemical-variation], and sample
CK-6 experienced polyphase major-element refertilization by
fractionated melt presumably generated below its entrainment depth. At the
same time, low levels of re-enrichment by alkali-basalt-like melt are evident
across the sample set. Deep partial melting and alkalic melt generation are
common features of slab window volcanism [@Hole1991] and may contribute to the
signature of depletion and re-enrichment recorded by the Crystal Knob
xenoliths.

The highly fractionated, alkalic magma of the Crystal Knob pipe
and its entrainment of both dunite
cumulates and spinel peridotite xenoliths suggest that it was sourced from a
multi-tiered network within the mantle lithosphere at depths > 45 km.
The fractally-scaled melt migration channels investigated by @Kelemen2000
provide a good potential model, in which cumulates are sometimes re-entrained
by small-volume volcanism during progressive upwards percolation of melt from
a deep mantle source. A deep, slowly-cooling body of slab window material,
locally mobilized as melt and rising through a thick lid of relict mantle
lithosphere, provides a mechanism both mid-Miocene hypabyssal
intrusives [@Stanley2000; @Ernst1974] and later
deeply-sourced, small-volume eruptions such as Crystal Knob.

## The timing of the Crystal Knob eruption {#sec:crystal_knob_eruption}

Although potentially sourced from slowly-propagating melts related to
the slab window, the ca. 1.65 Ma eruption of Crystal Knob (and other
Plio-Pleistocene volcanic eruptions in the Coast Ranges) was likely
proximally triggered by recent tectonism. Rapid uplift of the
central California coastal region at ca. 2 Ma [@Ducea2003b] could have
caused decompression melting in the lower lithosphere. Additionally,
Neogene dextral faulting provides a localized mechanism for transient
decompression leading to mobilization of small volumes of mantle
lithosphere melt. Crystal Knob is located ~15 km east of the Hosgri
fault, and its host Franciscan complex is pervasively cut by faults and
shear zones [@Cowan1978; @Seiders1989]. The Hosgri fault was likely
active during the eruption of the Crystal Knob neck [@Dickinson2005;
@Hardebeck2010], and theoretical and observational data on
intra-continental transform faults [@Platt2011; @Titus2007] indicate
that Hosgri fault shear could be distributed across 10s of kilometers
laterally in the lower crust and upper mantle [@fig:neogene_sections|c].

Elsewhere in the Coast Ranges, Plio-Pleistocene eruptions of
small-volume basalts are associated with the traces of active faults.
This includes the Coyote Lake pipe [@fig:context], which occurred ~150
km north of Crystal Knob along the San Andreas-Calaveras fault
bifurcation zone and entrained lower crust and upper mantle xenoliths
[@Jove1998; @Titus2007]. As at Crystal Knob, xenoliths recovered from
these flows record partial melting of the mantle markedly post-dating
any possible slab window opening. The interplay of localized
extensional transients with deep, low-volume melts is consistent with
infrequent but energetic recent volcanism in the Coast Ranges.

Conclusion
==========

The lithospheric structure of southern California, to first order created by
Cretaceous convergent margin tectonics, was severely
overprinted by two subsequent tectonic episodes: the impact and
subduction of the Shatsky Rise large igneous province conjugate during
the Late Cretaceous, and the progressive evolution of a transform
boundary in the Neogene. These episodes have remade the crustal
architecture of southern California and the central California Coast Ranges
outboard of the San Andreas Fault. Using constraints from the Crystal
Knob xenolith suite along with thermal modeling of tectonic scenarios, we show
that the mantle lithosphere beneath the central California coast was created
during the late Cretaceous and heated by an asthenospheric pulse in the
Neogene.

The Crystal Knob xenolith suite was entrained along
a depth gradient from ~45-75 km and erupted at 1.65 Ma. It has the isotopic signature of the
depleted convecting mantle, which is typical of mid-ocean ridges or
shallowly-ascended asthenosphere. Samples are variably depleted by partial
melting, and trace-element re-enrichment (and a single example of likely
major-element assimilation) suggests interaction with low-volume melts after
the formation and initial thermal equilibration of this mantle lithosphere
material.

Major element, trace element, and radiogenic isotope data for the
Crystal Knob xenolith suite equally satisfy the first-order geochemical
features of the shallow slab window, stalled slab, and Late Cretaceous
mantle duplex tectonic scenarios. Xenolith pressure-temperature
constraints, thermal modeling, and geochemical signatures of depletion
and re-enrichment together allow some discrimination between these
scenarios. Thermal modeling of a shallowly underplated slab window
predicts extremely hot geotherms that are untenable for the xenolith
constraints of this study, while the stalled slab and mantle nappe
scenarios are both reasonable. When the effects of potential
exhumation/erosion are qualitatively considered, the Monterey plate
stalled slab endmember scenario corresponds less well to constraints on
the upper-mantle geotherm. This, along with the poor correspondence of a
stalled slab to crustal geology and geodynamic constraints, leads us to
strongly favor the Late Cretaceous mantle duplex underplating scenario,
with reheating by a deep slab window in the Neogene.

A late-Cretaceous origin of the mantle lithosphere beneath the Coast Ranges
matches crustal geologic evidence of slab rollback and regional
extension during the Late Cretaceous, as the Shatsky Rise conjugate
subducted deeper into the mantle following its initial collision and shallow
subduction beneath the southern California convergent margin. This episode
built the mantle lithosphere beneath the Mojave province by duplexing
during the retreat of the Farallon Plate subducting slab [@Luffi2009], and
appears to have subsequently built the outboard mantle lithosphere beneath the
Crystal Knob eruption site.
The presence of underplated Cretaceous mantle lithosphere beneath the
Coast Ranges confirm that the entire lithospheric column, including the
Salinia nappes and Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan complex, were
formed in a single episode of extension during the Late Cretaceous.
The outer toe of this lithosphere-scale
accretionary belt was subsequently displaced along the San Andreas transform
system to its current location beneath the central California Coast Ranges.

In the Neogene, the underplated mantle lithosphere was reheated by the
Mendocino slab window, which opened as the Pacific--Farallon ridge encountered
the California convergent margin.
The deep mantle lithosphere appended to southern California
during the Cretaceous shielded the crust from intense
slab window heating and volcanism.
Peridotite major- and trace-element
re-enrichment and abundant dunite cumulate xenoliths and xenocrysts within the
Crystal Knob basalt record the percolation of fluids and melts through the
lithosphere. This percolation, the highly fractionated Crystal Knob basaltic
pipe, and the modeled thermal pulse at the base of the lithosphere can be
attributed to the ca. 24 Ma opening of an asthenospheric slab window at 70-90 km
depth. This interaction of the slab window with the base of an
integrated lithospheric column could explain the relatively subdued
response of coastal California to Neogene ridge subduction.
