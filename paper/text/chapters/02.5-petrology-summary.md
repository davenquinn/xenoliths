### Summary of xenolith petrology

The peridotite samples from Crystal Knob show a range of depletion in
major and trace elements. They are isotopically depleted, with an
$\epsilon_\mathrm{Nd}$ of
+10, and \ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .7029.

This corresponds to the depleted upper mantle [e.g. @Hoffman1997], with a
mantle upwelling source that has seen no contribution from the western
North American crust or continental lithosphere more generally.

The major-element refertilization of CK-6 implies significant mass
exchange and may be due to interaction with deep upwelling fluids.
The hottest/deepest samples are melt residues,
implying more melt extraction at deeper levels of the
lithospheric column.
