### Summary of xenolith petrology

The peridotite samples from Crystal Knob show a range of depletion in
major and trace elements. They are isotopically depleted, with an
$\epsilon_\mathrm{Nd}$ of
+10, and \ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .7029. <!-- (Daven, the Nd and Sr
data in Table 4 are given as measured. In the table you should also show
the time corrected Nd and Sr isotopic ratios and epslon Nd  value for a
correction of 1.65 Ma. You should then refer to these time corrected
numbers in the text and show these values on the Figure 10 Eps Nd-Sr
plot. The corrections will be small, but since we have dated the host it
would be best to use the time corrected values for time of entrainment.
-->
This corresponds to the depleted upper mantle [e.g. @Hoffman1997], with a
mantle upwelling source that has seen no contribution from the western
North American crust or continental lithosphere more generally.
