## Major-element thermometry

Electron-microprobe major-element data is used as the basis for pyroxene
Ca--exchange geothermometry. Several formulations of this reaction are
tested: BKN [@Brey1990] and TA98 [@Taylor1998] are
two slightly different formulations based on empirical calibration of the two-pyroxene Ca exchange
reaction in simple and natural systems. @Taylor1998 is explicitly calibrated to
account for errors arising from high Al content.
The Ca-in-orthopyroxene (Ca-OPX) thermometer [@Brey1990] is formulated for
use in the absence of clinopyroxene.
Together, these thermometers can query the full range of major-element compositions
seen in the Crystal Knob xenolith samples. Results are shown in
@tbl:thermometry and @fig:temp_comparisons.

### Error in thermometer calibrations

Core and rim compositions measured on the microprobe are separated to assess within-sample
temperature disequilibrium and late-stage (e.g. eruptive) heating. Analytical errors (caused by
uncertainty in microprobe data) are small, on the order of 5ºC (1$\sigma$).
Other sources of error include the calibration of the thermometer
and potential bias from within-sample disequilibrium. @Taylor1998
reports residuals of calibration of the thermometer to experimental
data which yield total errors of 50-60ºC (1$\sigma$). Unreported calibration errors for the
BKN and Ca-OPX thermometers are likely similar in scale [@Taylor1998]. In practice,
error distributions based on calibration with heterogeneous experimental
samples likely form an upper bound on relative errors. Within-sample scatter in measured temperatures
can be used to estimate the relative error of the thermometer, and the relative
performance of different thermometers can be used to assess the recovery of absolute temperatures.

Within-sample variation in temperatures can be useful in assessing the potential errors
in calculated temperatures. The dataset of pyroxene composition measurements is
grouped by location for thermometry, with a separate temperature calculated
for each individual nearest-neighbor pair of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene.
Analytical errors are propagated through the calculation.
The resulting distribution of temperatures for grain cores and rims for each sample
(with *n* ranging from 19 to 74 pairs per
group) accounts for within-sample variation and provides an
approximation of measurement precision.

TA98 and BKN temperatures have a strong linear relationship, with BKN
temperature estimates higher by up to 50ºC.
The disparity decreases
towards higher temperatures and conforms to the relationship between
the two thermometers found by @Nimis2010.
This relationship can be expressed as
$T_{\mathrm{BKN}} = 0.9~T_{\mathrm{TA98}} + 145$ for temperatures
in ºC.
@Nimis2010 shows that TA98 performs well against
experimental results in several scenarios and advises its use over BKN.
The Ca-in-OPX thermometer generally yields results coincident with BKN
temperatures (sensibly, as they were calibrated from the same dataset) [@Brey1990].
The low within-sample scatter of the Ca-in-OPX thermometer possibly
results from the fast diffusion and complete re-equilibration of small amounts of Ca in orthopyroxene,
or of the stability of relatively refractory orthopyroxene against late magmatic modification. <!-- *** --->

### Core temperatures

Average TA98 temperatures range from 957 to 1063ºC for cores and
955 to 1054ºC for rims [@tbl:thermometry].
CK-2 core temperatures indicate more complete
equilibration, with a standard deviation of only 2.3ºC (compared
with 8.2-12.4ºC for all other samples). Temperatures are distributed roughly normally
for most samples, but outlying clusters of measurements in CK-4 and CK-6 may indicate
two-pyroxene major element disequilibrium at millimeter scale.
In CK-4, a few grain cores with TA98
temperatures of 1100ºC are likely related to late-stage diffusion during
entrainment and eruption.
Within-sample temperature variability is a relatively minor feature: for grain cores in all samples,
the mean of pairwise analyses is within a few degrees
of the temperature calculated for average compositions of pyroxene phases across the sample.
This implies that the bulk of the temperature signature
is based on the equilibrium state of the sample.

### Rim temperatures

Rim temperatures (measured ~10 µm from grain edges) are generally higher than
core temperatures, although the level of disparity varies widely between samples.
CK-2 shows only modestly elevated rim temperatures, while CK-3 and CK-6
show significant scatter to temperatures ~180 ºC higher than grain cores
(CK-5 and CK-7 contain a few measurements of this type as well).
High and variable rim compositions may be related to fluid infiltration
during entrainment and eruption of the xenoliths, but with significant
mobilization of cations limited to grain rims. CK-4, which shows high core temperatures
and the most significant petrographic evidence of melt interaction, lacks
high-temperature rim compositions, implying more sustained equilibration with the Crystal
Knob melt.

### Two temperature cohorts

The samples can be divided into two clear cohorts based on equilibration temperatures. A cooler
group of samples, with a distribution of grain core temperatures centered at ~970ºC (TA98), contains CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7.
A hotter group, with a mean temperature of ~1050ºC (TA98) contains samples CK-3, CK-4, and CK-6.
This division between these two groups is robust and apparent in all thermometers, as well as in
other geochemical data.

This temperature distribution likely corresponds to the sourcing of these two sets of xenoliths from different
depths within a magmatic ascent system. Throughout this paper, the samples are color-coded, with
blue-green corresponding to the low-temperature array, and red-yellow representing
the high-temperature samples [@fig:major_elements‌-‌-@fig:depths].

## REE-in-pyroxene thermometry

We use the @Liang2013 REE-in-two-pyroxene thermometer to estimate the
equilibration temperature of the samples using an independent system.
The relative immobility of REEs allows assessment
of equilibrium temperatures over longer timescales than those queried
with two-pyroxene cation exchange thermometry.

\renewcommand{\D}{D^\mathrm{opx/cpx}}

Rare-earth abundances are compiled for SIMS measurements of
pyroxene phases in contact (2--3 pairs) for each xenolith sample.
A two-pyroxene equilibrium is calculated for each REE element and Y,
equivalent to $T_i [K] = B_i (\ln(\D_i)-A_i)^{-1}$.
These per-element equilibration temperatures are shown in
@fig:ree_temperatures.
The best-fitting line from the origin through each point
in $B$ vs. $\ln(\D)-A$ space
(using a robust regression with a Tukey biweight norm) yields
the equilibrium temperature for each sample.
Significant outliers from the fit are excluded from the thermometry,
and may represent effects of disequilibrium processes.

### Pyroxene rare-earth disequilibrium

CK-3 shows disequilibrium in La only, while CK-5 and CK-7 have disequilibrium
in several of the LREEs.
Sample CK-4 shows major disequilibrium in the light and medium REEs, with only
elements heavier than Ho retaining an equilibrium signature.

The pattern of disequilibrium in sample CK-4 suggests that $\D$ for the LREEs
is larger than anticipated relative to that for HREEs. This is perhaps
due to low clinopyroxene modes in the harzburgite CK-4. The shape of this
disequilibrium relationship may be traceable to the parabolic nature
of mineral-melt partition curves for both pyroxene phases, which are
incompletely modeled by a linear relationship when offset [@Sun2012;@Blundy2003].
Alternatively, low clinopyroxene modes in the harzburgite CK-4 could
result in more being incorporated into orthopyroxene, showing incomplete REE
diffusion throughout the sample. This is consistent with late re-enrichment
in LREEs from the Crystal Knob source magma.

All samples except CK-6 and CK-7 show results off the linear trendline for Eu.
This distinct disequilibrium was also found in calibration by @Sun2012, and is
dependent on the oxygen fugacity (and \ce{Eu^{2+}}/\ce{Eu^{3+}} ratio of the
host magma. The exact kinetics of this scenario are unclear, but it is
likely that REE equilibrium was achieved in a reducing environment
*(P. Asimow and J. Blundy, personal communication, 2016)*, or Eu rapidly and
differentially diffused out of the Crystal Knob xenoliths just prior to eruption.
These patterns could also be due to the effect of "ghost" plagioclase on
creating local europium enrichments and depletions in the neighborhood
of resorbed plagioclase grains. Such a pattern would suggest that the
xenoliths originated at shallow mantle lithosphere levels and was
transported deeper, causing plagioclase breakdown.
Discerning between these scenarios is difficult due to the low Eu counts
measured using ion-microprobe techniques.

General LREE disequilibrium between pyroxenes can be explained by a
fossil heating event that was retained only in rare-earth elements due
to their slow diffusion rates. This must have happened prior to
subsolidus re-equilibration in major elements, which implies that it is
not related to the eruptive episode. Alternatively, partition
coefficients for LREE and Eu could have been modified by an unusual
late-stage melt interaction favoring the extraction of LREE and Eu from
clinopyroxene. Overall, disequilibrium patterns in REE between
pyroxenes allude to possible focused heating of sample CK-4, poorly
understood equilibrium partition coefficients (for instance, due to
reducing mantle conditions), and incomplete linearizing assumptions in
the @Liang2013 thermometer. Untangling these effects is beyond the scope
of this work but presents several opportunities for further study.
Despite this disequilibrium, temperature estimates anchored by HREE
perform well as measured against major-element thermometry, even for
samples (such as CK-4) with generalized LREE disequilibrium.

### Comparison with major-element thermometry {#sec:temperature-significance}

Rare-earth exchange thermometry shows the samples as divided into
the same two groupings of temperatures as those found by major-element
thermometry. Temperatures measured for the low-temperature cohort are
most comparable to the TA98 results [@fig:ree_temperatures].
Given that the TA98 method has been
found to perform best among the pyroxene-exchange thermometers by
@Nimis2010, it seems likely that both the TA98 and REE temperatures show
long-term equilibrium with no significant thermal perturbations. For the
high-temperature cohort, particularly samples CK-4 and CK-6, the REE
method shows significantly higher equilibration temperatures than the
TA98 method. Rare-earths in pyroxene diffuse several orders of magnitude
slower than major elements [@Liang2013], so early thermal events can
leave an imprint on the distribution of rare-earths for much longer than
with major elements. It is likely that these higher temperatures are a
signature of a fossil heating event primarily affecting the deepest
samples. This is accompanied by major REE disequilibrium in sample CK-4,
which also contains the most intergranular melt channels.

Sample CK-4 records a significantly higher temperature for LREE than
both the other samples and its own HREE equilibration temperatures. This
likely shows that the LREEs were equilibrated at a much higher
temperature than the HREEs. This pronounced within-sample disequilibrium
could be the result of metasomatic processes, which is bolstered by the
fact that CK-4 shows the only significant melt-infiltration textures in
the sample set. It is likely, therefore, that CK-4 was subjected to a
short, transient heating event that was not fully equilibrated in HREE.
Further, since this transient heating is not reflected in major-element
temperatures, it is likely that the sample was subsequently equilibrated
at a lower temperature for a significant period of time. Also, given low
clinopyroxene modes, rare-earths added during refertilization may not be
completely homogenized throughout the sample.

## Geochemical variation within the Crystal Knob sample set

All of the Crystal Knob xenoliths analyzed are isotopically depleted, with an
initial $\epsilon_\mathrm{Nd}$ of +10, and \ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .7029.
This corresponds to the depleted upper mantle [e.g. @Hofmann1997], with a
mantle upwelling source that has seen no contribution from the western
North American crust or continental lithosphere more generally.
The mantle lithosphere sampled by the Crystal Knob suite was created
from the same convective mantle reservoir and is distinct from the overlying
crustal material.

However, the two cohorts in temperature seem to sample mantle material
with somewhat different major- and trace-element characteristics. In
major elements, the low-temperature cohort generally includes phases
with relatively fertile compositions, with modal abundances showing a
trend towards depletion by decrease in the abundance of pyroxene phases.
This is supplemented by relatively undepleted pyroxene trace-element
patterns: In clinopyroxene trace elements, the low-temperature cohort
ranges from essentially undepleted to low levels of depletion
characteristic of the least-depleted abyssal peridotites
[@fig:cpx_literature_comparison].

The high-temperature samples show major-element compositions with lower
Mg\#s, suggesting that depletion progressed differently, with all phases
losing volatile elements during depletion. Within this cohort, CK-3 and
CK-4 show significantly higher levels of REE depletion and extremely low
clinopyroxene modes, as well as distinct enrichments in clinopyroxene
LREEs, which likely correspond to assimilation of enriching fluid and
are notably different from profiles found in abyssal peridotites
[@fig:cpx_literature_comparison]. They also contain chromian spinels,
which are a product of increased levels of melt extraction.

Phases within sample CK-6 shows uniformly low Mg\#s, suggesting
depletion. However, high modal abundance of pyroxene
phases suggests some amount of major-element re-enrichment after
formation. This is bolstered by petrographic evidence of significant
growth and aggregation of pyroxene grains, unique in the sample set. It is
relatively undepleted in REEs and shows no significant temperature
disequilibrium in any thermometer including REE. This major-element
refertilization is likely a result of assimilation of mantle material
and re-equilibration near the solidus. It implies significant mass
exchange and may be due to interaction with deep upwelling fluids.

Broadly, the results of geochemical and thermometric studies of the
Crystal Knob suite suggest that the mantle lithosphere beneath central
California was affected by differing levels of depletion and
re-enrichment. The shallower samples are less depleted, and the hottest
and deepest samples are melt residues, implying more melt extraction at
deeper levels of the lithospheric column. Modeling suggests that
re-enrichment happened throughout the sample set, and all clinopyroxene
rare-earth elements show effects of re-enrichment except for CK-2.
However, disequilibrium in REE (CK-4) and unusual major element
signatures (CK-6) occur in the hotter samples. This suggests that the
samples were affected by alteration that was the most intense at deeper
depths sometime in their post-emplacement and pre-eruptive history.
