## Major-element thermometry

Electron-microprobe major-element data is used as the basis for pyroxene
Ca--exchange geothermometry. Several formulations of this reaction are
tested: BKN [@Brey1990] and TA98 [@Taylor1998] are
two slightly different formulations based on empirical calibration of the two-pyroxene Ca exchange
reaction in simple and natural systems. @Taylor1998 is explicitly calibrated to
account for errors arising from high Na content.
The Ca-in-orthopyroxene (Ca-OPX) thermometer [@Brey1990] is formulated for
use in the absence of clinopyroxene.
Together, these thermometers can query the full range of major-element compositions
seen in the Crystal Knob xenolith samples. Results are shown in
@tbl:thermometry and @fig:temp_comparisons.

### Error in thermometer calibrations

Core and rim compositions are separated to assess within-sample
temperature disequilibrium and late-stage (e.g. eruptive) heating. Analytical errors (caused by
uncertainty in microprobe data) are small, on the order of 5ºC (1$\sigma$).
Other sources of error include the calibration of the thermometer
and potential bias from within-sample disequilibrium. @Taylor1998
reports residuals of calibration of the thermometer to experimental
data which yield total errors of 50-60ºC (1$\sigma$). Unreported calibration errors for the
BKN and Ca-OPX thermometers are likely similar in scale [@Taylor1998]. In practice,
error distributions based on calibration with heterogeneous experimental
samples likely form an upper bound on relative errors. Within-sample scatter in measured temperatures
can be used to estimate the relative error of recovered temperatures, and the relative
performance of different thermometers can be used to infer absolute temperatures.

Within-sample temperature variation can be useful in assessing the potential errors
in calculated temperatures. The dataset of pyroxene composition measurements is
grouped by location for thermometry, with a separate temperature calculated
for each individual nearest-neighbor pair of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene.
Analytical errors are propagated through the calculation.
The resulting distribution of temperatures for grain cores and rims for each sample
(with *n* ranging from 19 to 74 pairs per
group) accounts for within-sample variation and provides an
approximation of measurement precision.

TA98 and BKN temperatures have a strong linear relationship, with BKN
temperature estimates higher by up to 50ºC.
The disparity decreases
towards higher temperatures and conforms to the relationship between
the two thermometers found by @Nimis2010.
This relationship can be expressed as
$T_{\mathrm{BKN}} = 0.9~T_{\mathrm{TA98}} + 145$ [ºC].
@Nimis2010 shows that TA98 performs well against
experimental results in several scenarios and advises its use over BKN.
The Ca-in-OPX thermometer sensibly yields results coincident with BKN
temperatures (as they were calibrated from the same dataset) [@Brey1990].
The low within-sample scatter of the Ca-in-OPX thermometer possibly
results from the fast diffusion and complete re-equilibration of small amounts of Ca in orthopyroxene,
or of the stability of relatively refractory orthopyroxene against late magmatic modification. <!-- *** --->

### Core temperatures

Average TA98 temperatures range from 957 to 1063ºC for cores and
955 to 1054ºC for rims [@tbl:thermometry].
CK-2 core temperatures indicate more complete
equilibration, with a standard deviation of only 2.3ºC (compared
with 8.2-12.4ºC for all other samples). Temperatures are distributed roughly normally
for most samples, but outlying clusters in CK-4 and CK-6 may indicate
two-pyroxene major element disequilibrium at millimeter scale.
In CK-4, a few grain cores with TA98
temperatures of 1100ºC are likely related to late-stage diffusion during
entrainment and eruption.
Within-sample temperature variability is a relatively minor feature: for grain cores in all samples,
the mean of pairwise analyses is within a few degrees
of the temperature calculated for average compositions of pyroxene phases across the sample.
This implies that measured temperatures are representative of
equilibrium.

### Rim temperatures

Rim temperatures (measured ~10 µm from grain edges) are generally higher than
core temperatures, although the level of disparity varies widely between samples.
CK-2 shows only modestly elevated rim temperatures, while CK-3 and CK-6
show significant scatter to temperatures ~180 ºC higher than grain cores
(CK-5 and CK-7 contain a few measurements of this type as well).
High and variable rim compositions may be related to melt infiltration
during entrainment and eruption of the xenoliths, but with significant
mobilization of cations limited to grain rims. CK-4, which shows high core temperatures
and the most significant petrographic evidence of melt infiltration, lacks
high-temperature rim compositions, suggesting equilibration at high
temperature, possibly in the Crystal Knob melt.

### Two temperature cohorts

The samples can be divided into two cohorts based on equilibration
temperatures. A cooler group of samples, with a distribution of grain core
temperatures centered at ~970ºC (TA98), contains CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7. A hotter
group, with a mean temperature of ~1050ºC (TA98) contains samples CK-3, CK-4,
and CK-6. This division between these two groups is robust and apparent in all
thermometers, and aligns with geochemical differences within the sample set,
with the hotter samples having higher spinel Cr\# and greater HREE depletion.
The range of temperatures likely records the sourcing of two sets of xenoliths
from different depths within a magmatic ascent system. Throughout this paper,
the samples are color-coded, with blue-green corresponding to the
low-temperature array, and red-yellow representing the high-temperature samples
\[@fig:major_elements‌-‌-@fig:depth\].

## REE-in-pyroxene thermometry

We use the @Liang2013 REE-in-two-pyroxene thermometer to estimate the
equilibration temperature of the samples using an independent system.
The relative immobility of REEs allows assessment
of equilibrium temperatures over longer timescales than those queried
with two-pyroxene cation exchange thermometry.

\renewcommand{\D}{D^\mathrm{opx/cpx}}

Rare-earth abundances are compiled for SIMS measurements of
pyroxene phases in contact (2--3 pairs) for each xenolith sample.
A two-pyroxene equilibrium is calculated for each REE and Y,
and is shown in @fig:ree_temperatures. A robust regression with a
Tukey biweight norm is used to find the equilibrium temperature for each
sample.
Significant outliers from the fit are excluded from thermometry,
and may represent effects of disequilibrium processes.

### Pyroxene rare-earth disequilibrium

CK-3 shows misfit in La only, while CK-5 and CK-7 have disequilibrium
in several of the LREEs.
Sample CK-4 shows major disequilibrium in the light and medium REEs, with only
elements heavier than Ho retaining a linear relationship.

The pattern of disequilibrium in sample CK-4 suggests that the partition
coefficient $\D$ for the LREEs
is larger than anticipated relative to that for HREEs. This is perhaps
due to low clinopyroxene modes in the harzburgite CK-4, forcing assimilated
REEs into orthopyroxene. The shape of this
disequilibrium may be due to the parabolic nature
of mineral-melt partition curves for both pyroxene phases, which are
incompletely modeled by a linear relationship when offset [@Blundy2003; @Sun2012].
Alternatively, low clinopyroxene modes in the harzburgite CK-4 could
result in the incorporation of more REEs into orthopyroxene than is predicted by the
thermometer (@fig:trace_elements shows pronounced LREE enrichment in orthopyroxenes for CK-3 and CK-4).
Regardless, since measured LREEs are consistently enriched,
with low errors for both orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene, we conclude
that anomalies in LREE temperature do not signal disequilibrium
compositions.

All samples except CK-6 and CK-7 show results off the linear trendline for Eu.
This distinct disequilibrium was discussed @Sun2012, and is
dependent on the oxygen fugacity (and \ce{Eu^{2+}}/\ce{Eu^{3+}} ratio) of the
host magma. In normal magmas, this patterns could also arise from the
effect of "ghost" plagioclase,
which could create local europium enrichments and depletions in the neighborhood
of resorbed plagioclase grains. This would suggest that the
xenoliths originated at shallow mantle lithosphere levels and were
transported deeper, causing plagioclase breakdown.
Discerning between these scenarios is difficult due to the low Eu counts
measured using ion-microprobe techniques.

General LREE disequilibrium between pyroxenes can be explained by a
fossil heating event that was retained only in REEs due
to their slow diffusion rates. This must have happened prior to
subsolidus re-equilibration in major elements, which implies that it is
not related to the eruptive episode. Overall, disequilibrium patterns in REE between
pyroxenes allude to possible focused heating of sample CK-4, poorly
understood equilibrium partition coefficients (for instance, due to
reducing mantle conditions), and incomplete linearizing assumptions in
the @Liang2013 thermometer. Untangling these effects is beyond the scope
of this work but presents several opportunities for further study.
Even for samples with pronounced LREE disequilibrium,
temperature estimates anchored by HREE perform well against major-element thermometry.

### Comparison with major-element thermometry {#sec:temperature-significance}

Rare-earth exchange thermometry shows the samples as divided into
the same two temperature groupings as those found by major-element
thermometry. REE temperatures measured for the low-temperature cohort are
most comparable to the TA98 results [@fig:ree_temperatures].
Given that the TA98 method has been
found to perform best among the pyroxene-exchange thermometers by
@Nimis2010, both the TA98 and REE temperatures likely show
long-term equilibrium with no significant thermal perturbations. For the
high-temperature cohort, particularly samples CK-4 and CK-6, the REE
method shows significantly higher equilibration temperatures than TA98.
Trivalent rare-earths in pyroxene diffuse several orders of magnitude
slower than bivalent major elements [@Liang2013], so early thermal events can
leave an imprint on the distribution of rare-earths for much longer than
with major elements. It is likely that these higher temperatures are a
signature of a fossil high-temperature event primarily affecting the deepest
samples.

Sample CK-4 records a significantly higher temperature for individual LREEs than
both the other samples and its own HREE equilibration temperatures. This
likely shows that LREEs were equilibrated at a much higher
temperature than HREEs. This pronounced within-sample disequilibrium
could be the result of metasomatic processes, which is bolstered by the
fact that CK-4 shows the only significant melt-infiltration textures (intergranular
melt channels) in the sample set [@fig:textures].
CK-4 was likely subjected to a
transient heating event that was not fully equilibrated in HREEs.
Sample CK-6 has a high-temperature signature across the entire range of rare-earth
elements, while CK-3 records a much lower temperature in line with major-element
thermometry.
Excess heating recorded by REE thermometry for CK-4 and CK-6 is not
reflected in major-element temperatures, which show that the sample reached a lower-temperature
equilibrium after this heating event.
