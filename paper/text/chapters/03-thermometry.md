## Major-element thermometry

Electron-microprobe major-element data is used as the basis for pyroxene
Ca--exchange geothermometry. Several complimentary formulations are used: BKN
[@Brey1990] and TA98 [@Taylor1998] are two slightly different formulations
based on empirical calibration of the two-pyroxene Ca exchange reaction in
simple and natural systems. @Taylor1998 is explicitly calibrated to account
for errors arising from high Na content. The Ca-in-orthopyroxene (Ca-OPX)
thermometer [@Brey1990] is formulated for use in the absence of clinopyroxene.
Results for all thermometers are shown in @tbl:thermometry and
@fig:temp_comparisons.

### Error in thermometer calibrations

Core and rim compositions are separated to assess within-sample
temperature disequilibrium and late-stage (e.g. eruptive) heating. Analytical errors (caused by
uncertainty in microprobe data) are small, on the order of 5ºC (1$\sigma$).
Other sources of error include the calibration of the thermometer
and potential bias from within-sample disequilibrium. @Taylor1998
reports residuals of calibration of the thermometer to experimental
data which yield total errors of 50-60ºC (1$\sigma$). Unreported calibration errors for the
BKN and Ca-OPX thermometers are likely similar in scale [@Taylor1998]. In practice,
error distributions based on calibration with heterogeneous experimental
samples likely form an upper bound on relative errors.

Within-sample variation in measured temperatures is a proxy for the relative
error of recovered temperatures. The dataset of pyroxene composition
measurements is grouped by location for thermometry, with a separate
temperature calculated for each individual nearest-neighbor pair of
orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene. Analytical errors are propagated through the
calculation. The resulting distribution of temperatures for grain cores and
rims for each sample (with *n* ranging from 19 to 74 pairs per group)
accounts for within-sample variation and provides an approximation of
measurement precision.

The relative performance of different thermometers can be used to infer
absolute temperatures. TA98 and BKN temperatures have a strong linear
relationship, with BKN temperature estimates higher by up to 50ºC. The
disparity decreases towards higher temperatures and conforms to the
relationship between the two thermometers found by @Nimis2010. This
relationship can be expressed as $T_{\mathrm{BKN}} = 0.9~T_{\mathrm{TA98}}
+ 145$ [ºC]. The Ca-in-OPX thermometer yields results coincident with BKN
(sensibly, based on their shared calibration) [@Brey1990]. The low
within-sample scatter of the Ca-in-OPX thermometer likely results from the fast
diffusion and complete re-equilibration of small amounts of Ca in
orthopyroxene. @Nimis2010 advises the preferred use of TA98 based on
experimental results in several scenarios. Given the largely coincident results
of all thermometers, we accept their preference for further analysis.

### Core temperatures

Average TA98 temperatures range from 957 to 1063ºC for cores and
955 to 1054ºC for rims [@tbl:thermometry].
CK-2 core temperatures indicate more complete
equilibration, with a standard deviation of only 2.3ºC (compared
with 8.2-12.4ºC for all other samples). Temperatures are distributed roughly normally
for most samples, but outlying clusters in CK-4 and CK-6 may indicate
two-pyroxene major element disequilibrium at millimeter scale.
In CK-4, a few grain cores with TA98
temperatures of 1100ºC are likely related to late-stage diffusion during
entrainment and eruption.
Within-sample temperature variability is a relatively minor feature: for grain cores in all samples,
the mean of pairwise analyses is within a few degrees
of the temperature calculated for average compositions of pyroxene phases across the sample.
This implies that measured temperatures are representative of
equilibrium.

### Rim temperatures

Rim temperatures (measured ~10 µm from grain edges) are generally higher than
core temperatures, although the level of disparity varies widely between samples.
CK-2 shows only modestly elevated rim temperatures, while CK-3 and CK-6
show significant scatter to temperatures ~180 ºC higher than grain cores
(CK-5 and CK-7 contain a few measurements of this type as well).
High and variable rim compositions may be related to melt infiltration
during entrainment and eruption of the xenoliths, but with significant
mobilization of cations limited to grain rims. CK-4, which shows high core temperatures
and the most significant petrographic evidence of melt infiltration, lacks
high-temperature rim compositions, suggesting equilibration at high
temperature, possibly in the Crystal Knob melt.

### Two temperature cohorts

The samples can be divided into two cohorts based on equilibration temperature.
A cooler group (samples CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7) has grain core temperatures
clustered at ~970ºC (TA98). A hotter group (samples CK-3, CK-4, and CK-6) has
a mean temperature of ~1050ºC (TA98). The division between these two groups is
robust, apparent in all thermometers, and aligned with geochemical differences
within the sample set. The hotter samples have higher spinel Cr\# and greater
HREE depletion, and the range of temperatures likely records the sourcing of
two sets of xenoliths from different depths within a magmatic ascent system.
Throughout this paper, the samples are color-coded, with blue-green
corresponding to the low-temperature array, and red-yellow representing the
high-temperature samples \[@fig:major_elements‌-‌-@fig:depth\].

## REE-in-pyroxene thermometry

We use the @Liang2013 REE-in-two-pyroxene thermometer to estimate the
equilibration temperature of the samples using an independent system. The
relative immobility of REEs allows assessment of equilibrium temperatures over
longer timescales than those queried with two-pyroxene cation exchange
thermometry.

Rare-earth abundances are compiled for SIMS measurements of
pyroxene phases in contact (2--3 pairs) for each xenolith sample.
A two-pyroxene equilibrium is calculated for each REE and Y, and is shown in
@fig:ree_temperatures|a. A robust regression with a Tukey biweight norm is used
to find the equilibrium temperature for each sample. Significant outliers from
the fit are excluded from thermometry and are discussed below.

Measured temperatures are between ~950 and 1100 ºC for the sample set
[@tbl:thermometry] and broadly correspond to TA98 temperatures for each sample
[@fig:ree_temperatures|b and @fig:temp_summary], although some differences may
be diagnostic of preserved fossil heating events.

### Pyroxene rare-earth disequilibrium

CK-3 shows misfit in La, while CK-5 and CK-7 have disequilibrium in several
LREEs. Sample CK-4 shows major disequilibrium in the light and medium REEs,
with only elements heavier than Ho retaining a linear relationship.

The pattern of disequilibrium in sample CK-4 suggests that the partition
coefficient $D^\mathrm{opx/cpx}$ for the LREEs is larger than anticipated
relative to that for HREEs. This is perhaps due to low clinopyroxene modes in
the harzburgite CK-4, forcing assimilated REEs into orthopyroxene. The shape of
this disequilibrium may be due to the parabolic nature of mineral-melt
partition curves for both pyroxene phases, which are incompletely modeled by
a linear relationship when offset [@Blundy2003; @Sun2012]. Alternatively, the
incorporation of more LREEs into orthopyroxene due to low clinopyroxene modes
[@fig:trace_elements] could magnify any miscalibration of the thermometer.
Regardless, since measured LREEs are consistently enriched, with low errors
for both orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene, we conclude that anomalies in LREE
temperature do not signal disequilibrium compositions.

All samples except CK-6 and CK-7 show results off the linear trendline for Eu.
This disequilibrium, discussed @Sun2012, is dependent on the oxygen
fugacity (and \ce{Eu^{2+}}/\ce{Eu^{3+}} ratio) of the host magma. In normal
magmas, this pattern could also arise from the effect of "ghost" plagioclase,
which can create local europium enrichments and depletions in the neighborhood
of resorbed plagioclase grains. This would suggest that the xenoliths
originated in the shallow mantle lithosphere and were transported deeper,
causing plagioclase breakdown. Discerning between these scenarios is difficult
due to the low Eu counts measured using ion-microprobe techniques.

General LREE disequilibrium between pyroxenes can be explained by a
fossil heating event that was retained only in REEs due
to their slow diffusion rates. This must have happened prior to subsolidus
re-equilibration in major elements, and is thus unrelated to the Crystal Knob
eruption. Overall, REE disequilibrium between pyroxenes allude to possible
focused heating of sample CK-4, poorly understood equilibrium partition
coefficients (for instance, due to reducing mantle conditions), and incomplete
linearizing assumptions in the @Liang2013 thermometer. Untangling these effects
is beyond the scope of this work but presents several opportunities for further
study.

### Comparison with major-element thermometry {#sec:temperature-significance}

Rare-earth exchange thermometry confirms the temperature groupings found by
major-element thermometry [@fig:temp_summary]. REE temperatures of 950-970 ºC for the
low-temperature cohort are most comparable to the TA98 results. For these
samples, the TA98 and REE temperatures together record long-term equilibrium
with no significant thermal perturbations. In the high-temperature cohort,
samples CK-4 and CK-6 record REE temperatures significantly higher than TA98
(~1080 ºC vs. ~1040 ºC). CK-3 records a lower temperature in line with
major-element thermometry. Trivalent rare-earths in pyroxene diffuse several
orders of magnitude slower than bivalent major elements [@Liang2013], so
high-temperature events can set the distribution of rare-earths despite
subsequent major-element re-equilibration at lower temperature. Excess
heating recorded by REE thermometry for CK-4 and CK-6 and not reflected in
major-element temperatures is likely due to a fossil heating event primarily
affecting the deepest samples.

CK-4 may have experienced a unique transient heating event, with individual
LREE cations recording high temperatures (>1200 ºC)
in disequilibrium with the ~1070 ºC HREE temperature [@fig:ree_temperatures|a].
This event could result from metasomatic processes, which possibly correspond
to the melt-infiltration textures (intergranular melt channels) unique to this
sample [@fig:textures].
