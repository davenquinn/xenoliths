## Heat-flow constraints on the geotherm

Studies relying on surface heat flow form the basis of attempts to estimate the
thermal structure and evolution history of the mantle lithosphere beneath the
central California coast ranges [@Erkan2008;@Erkan2009].
These studies are based on borehole measurements of heat flux in wells >
100 m deep and
show high (60-90 mW/m^2) heat flows in the entire Coast Range belt.
These workers refer to a "Coast Range Thermal Anomaly"
(CRTA) of high surface heat flux measurements in a broad swath of high geothermal gradients
across the entire Coast Range belt, both inboard and outboard of the San Andreas fault zone.
The heat flow in the Coast Ranges starkly contrast
with low heat flows observed in the adjacent Great Valley,
and in the Sierra Nevada, but are similar
to those measured in the Mojave province.

lot</comment>

Regionally averaged continental surface heat flows typically range from
lows of 20 mW/m^2 in cratonic cores to 120 mW/m^2 in focused areas of
active mantle upwelling (e.g. the southern Salton Trough)
[@Pollack1977; @Erkan2009], so the values reported for the CRTA are
high for areas with a relatively deep lithosphere.


Factors such as shear heating, fluid
circulation along faults, and rapid surface uplift have been proposed to
account for high heat flows in the Coast Ranges [@Erkan2009]. However, the extent to which these
surface heat flows are representative of the true integrated geotherm over the
entire lithospheric column is unclear. Evaluating the nature of these constraints
on the actual thermal structure of the lithosphere is critical to understanding
the tectonic history of the Coast Range belt.

Heat flow
measurements in the Coast Ranges are likely to be maximum estimates of the regionally-averaged heat
flow and geothermal gradient due to several factors including the possibility
of localized uplift, highly radiogenic crust near the surface (e.g.
Salinian granodiorites and tonalites), and regional heat diffusion by fluid
circulation within the San Andreas fault system.
Under any of these scenarios, extrapolations of the lithosphere-averaged geotherm
from surface heat flow estimates likely produce minimum estimates of sample depth.

The Coast Ranges are geologically active and affected by
geothermal and erosional processes. Recent increases in erosion such as
those documented post 2 Ma in the Santa Lucia Range [@Ducea2003b]
could significantly raise the geothermal gradient in the Coast Ranges
from the Miocene to the present.
Over longer timescales, the inward stepping of the transverse plate
boundary to the San Andreas fault zone has generated significant
shortening and uplift in the Coast Ranges since the Miocene
[@Dickinson2005].

The geothermal gradient may be affected by regional differences in
thermal conductivity, which can be enhanced by hydrothermal circulation
in the presence of fractures.
@Lachenbruch1980 concluded that the CRTA could not be generated by
conductive fault heating alone, but was also hesitant to invoke fluid
flow to explain a regionally averaged thermal gradient.
However, areas underlain by an intact batholithic crustal column
(e.g. the Sierra Nevada and Central Valley,
the Peninsular Ranges, and the Santa Lucia range) show relatively
low heat flows. This suggests that fluid transport
or localized upwelling along the SAFZ is to blame for anomalously high
surface heat flows in the Coast Range belt.
@Kennedy1997 shows the presence of mantle fluids in the San Andreas
fault zone, giving credence to the idea deep fluid transport.

The eruption of Crystal Knob itself demonstrates that a fully conductive
geotherm is unreasonable, as at least *some* heat was advected to the
surface by this and other volcanic edifices (e.g. Coyote Creek and Clear
Lake) since the Pleistocene.
All of these potential estimation effects for a geothermal gradient have
the effect of making it look more pronounced than it really is. Thus, it
seems likely that the gradients shown are a maximum limit on allowed
geothermal gradient.

Next, we approach a different facet of the problem, and
attempt to construct model geothermal scenarios that forecast the modern geotherm based on the tectonic history of the rocks.
To support the evaluation of the possible tectonic scenarios for the rocks, we model
the relaxation of the geotherm during subduction and underplating.
We use a series of model setups corresponding to the tectonic scenarios
outlined above.
