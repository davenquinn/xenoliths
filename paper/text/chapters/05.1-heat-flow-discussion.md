# Thermal constraints on lithospheric structure and history {#sec:heat-flow}

Studies relying on surface heat flows form the basis of attempts to estimate the
thermal structure and evolutionary history of the mantle lithosphere beneath the
central California coast ranges.
@Erkan2008 and @Erkan2009 studied heat flow data across the western U.S.
based on borehole measurements of heat flux in wells > 100 m deep.
These workers found a "Coast Range Thermal Anomaly"
(CRTA) of high surface heat flux measurements in a broad swath across the entire Coast Range belt, both inboard and outboard of the San Andreas fault zone.

The heat flows in this zone range from 60-90 mW/m^2, relatively high given typical 
regionally averaged continental heat flows ranging from lows of 20 mW/m^2 in
cratonic cores to 120 mW/m^2 in focused areas of active mantle upwelling (e.g.
the southern Salton Trough) [@Pollack1977; @Erkan2009].
The heat flow in the Coast Ranges starkly contrasts
with low heat flows observed in the adjacent Great Valley,
and in the Sierra Nevada, but are similar
to those measured in the Mojave province.

Factors such as shear heating, fluid
circulation along faults, and rapid surface uplift have been proposed to
account for high heat flows in the Coast Ranges [@Erkan2009]. However, the extent to which these
surface heat flows are representative of the true integrated geotherm over the
entire lithospheric column is unclear. Evaluating the nature of these constraints
on the actual thermal structure of the lithosphere is critical to understanding
the tectonic history of the Coast Range belt.

Heat flow measurements in the Coast Ranges are likely to
be maximum estimates of the regionally-averaged heat
flow and geothermal gradient due to several factors including the possibility
of localized uplift, highly radiogenic crust near the surface (e.g.
Salinian granodiorites and tonalites), and regional heat diffusion by fluid
circulation within the San Andreas transform system.
Under any of these scenarios, extrapolations of the lithosphere-averaged geotherm
from surface heat flow estimates likely produce minimum estimates of sample depth.
Recent increases in rock uplift and erosion such as
those documented post 2 Ma in the Santa Lucia Range [@Ducea2003b]
could significantly raise the geothermal gradient in the Coast Ranges
from the Miocene to the present.

The geothermal gradient may be affected by regional differences in
thermal conductivity, which can be enhanced by hydrothermal circulation
in the presence of fractures.
@Lachenbruch1980 concluded that high heat flows in the Coast Ranges
could not be generated by
conductive fault heating alone, but was also hesitant to invoke fluid
flow to explain a regionally averaged thermal gradient.
However, areas underlain by an intact batholithic crustal column
(e.g. the Sierra Nevada the Peninsular Ranges) show relatively
low heat flows. This suggests that fluid transport
or localized upwelling along the San Andreas transform system is the
origin of anomalously high surface heat flows in the Coast Range belt.
@Kennedy1997 shows the presence of mantle fluids in the San Andreas
fault zone, giving credence to the idea deep fluid transport.
The eruption of Crystal Knob itself demonstrates that a fully conductive
geotherm is unreasonable, as at least *some* heat was advected to the
surface by this and other volcanic edifices (e.g. Coyote Lake
[@fig:context]) since the Pleistocene.

In sum, estimates of the geothermal gradient derived from surface heat flow may
overestimate the geothermal gradient at depth, especially in the presence of
fluid flow and radiogenic rocks near the surface. Thus, it seems likely that
the gradients given in @Erkan2009 are a maximum limit on the geothermal
gradient in the mantle lithosphere.

Next, we attempt to model the geotherm sampled by Crystal Knob under
different tectonic scenarios.
To support the evaluation of the possible tectonic scenarios for the rocks, we model
the relaxation of the geotherm during subduction and underplating.
We use a series of model setups corresponding to the tectonic scenarios
outlined in @sec:tectonic_scenarios.
