# Origin of the mantle lithosphere beneath Crystal Knob

Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic and trace-element compositions of peridotite xenoliths
demonstrate that the mantle lithosphere that was sampled by the Crystal Knob
volcanic neck is sourced from the depleted mantle, with no contribution from
either recycled crustal material or ancient sub-continental mantle lithosphere.
The lack of radiogenically enriched arc residues confirms the unrooted nature
of Salinia continental arc rocks [e.g. @Hall2013] that lie slivered above the
Franciscan accretionary complex that dominates the regional crustal column.

The Franciscan complex of the region was assembled by sustained subduction of
the Farallon plate during the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic [@Cowan1978;
@Saleeby1986; @Seton2012; @Chapman2016a]. The mantle lithosphere of the region
may have been constructed from partly subducted Farallon-plate upper mantle,
late in this Franciscan accretionary history. Another mechanism could have
operated following the cessation of Farallon plate subduction and during the
establishment of the San Andreas transform system. Based on the regional
geologic history and constraints from crustal structure, we identify several
viable tectonic scenarios for the formation of the mantle lithosphere beneath
coastal central California, which we summarize in
@sec:slab_window‌-‌-@sec:farallon_nappe.

## Thermal constraints on lithospheric structure and history {#sec:heat-flow}

Previous studies have used surface heat flows to estimate the thermal structure
and evolution of the mantle lithosphere beneath the central California coast
ranges. @Blackwell2004 compiled a heat flow database across the western U.S.
based on borehole measurements of heat flux in wells > 100 m deep. A "Coast
Range Thermal Anomaly" of high surface heat flux covers the entire Coast Range
belt, both inboard and outboard of the San Andreas fault zone. This zone has
heat flows of 60-90 mW/m^2, similar to the Mojave province but much higher than
in the adjacent Central Valley and Sierra Nevada (20-40 mW/m^2). Coast Range
heat flows are high in the global distribution of regionally averaged
continental heat flows, which ranges from lows of 20 mW/m^2 in cratonic cores
to 120 mW/m^2 in focused areas of active mantle upwelling (e.g. the southern
Salton Trough) [@Pollack1977; @Erkan2009].

Factors such as shear heating, fluid
circulation along faults, and rapid surface uplift have been proposed to
account for high heat flows in the Coast Ranges [@Erkan2009]. However, the extent to which these
surface heat flows are representative of the true integrated geotherm over the
entire lithospheric column is unclear. Evaluating the nature of these constraints
on the actual thermal structure of the lithosphere is critical to understanding
the tectonic history of the Coast Range belt.

Heat flow measurements in the Coast Ranges are likely to
be maximum estimates of the regionally-averaged heat
flow and geothermal gradient due to several factors including
localized uplift, highly radiogenic crust near the surface (e.g.
Salinian granodiorites and tonalites), and regional heat diffusion by fluid
circulation within the San Andreas transform system.
Recent increases in rock uplift and erosion such as
those documented since 2 Ma in the Santa Lucia Range [@Ducea2003b] could
significantly raise the crustal geothermal gradient in the Coast Ranges. Under
any of these scenarios, the gradients given in @Erkan2009 represent a maximum
limit on the geothermal gradient in the mantle lithosphere.

The geothermal gradient may be affected by regional differences in
thermal conductivity, which can be enhanced by hydrothermal circulation
in the presence of fractures.
@Lachenbruch1980 concluded that high heat flows in the Coast Ranges
could not be generated by
conductive fault heating alone, but were hesitant to invoke elevation of
the regionally averaged thermal gradient by fluid flow.
However, areas underlain by an intact batholithic crustal column
(e.g. the Sierra Nevada the Peninsular Ranges) show relatively
low heat flows. This suggests that fluid transport
or localized upwelling along the San Andreas transform system may
contribute significantly to anomalously high surface heat flow in the
Coast Ranges.
@Kennedy1997 shows the presence of mantle fluids in the San Andreas
fault zone, suggesting that deep fluid transport may occur in the region.
The eruption of Crystal Knob itself demonstrates that a fully conductive
geotherm is unreasonable, as at least *some* heat was advected to the
surface by this and other volcanic edifices, such as Coyote Lake
[@fig:context], since the Pleistocene.

In sum, estimates of the geothermal gradient derived from surface heat flow may
overestimate the geothermal gradient at depth, especially in the presence of
fluid flow and radiogenic rocks near the surface.
Thus, extrapolations of the lithosphere-averaged geotherm
from surface heat flow estimates likely produce minimum estimates of sample depth.
Next, we outline several tectonic features that could affect the thermal
structure of the California coastal region.
