## Peridotite xenoliths {#sec:xenoliths}
<!--[[textures]]-->

<!--[[sample_petrography]]-->
<!--[[microscope-images]]-->

The peridotite samples (CK-2 through CK-7) are texturally classified using
the scheme of @Pike1977. All samples display an allotriomorphic granular
texture with anisotropy largely absent. There are
no significant petrographically observed plastic deformation features
(e.g. kink domains in olivine grains) in any of the samples. However,
samples CK-2 and CK-5 exhibit a weak shape-preferred alignment in elongate
spinels.

Minor late-stage alteration products are seen in all peridotite samples.
These include variably Fe-rich grain boundaries of major phases and Ti
enrichment in pyroxene rims (<10 µm from the grain
edge). Sample CK-4 contains an alteration channel that cuts linearly
across the thin section. This channel is bounded by resorbed boundaries
of the major phases (olivine and orthopyroxene) and hosts
microcrystalline clinopyroxene, 10 µm-scale euhedral spinels,
and minor amphibole. Near this melt channel, thin streamers of
intergranular fill show compositions enriched in Na and Ti. These
fills are present (but less extensive) in sample CK-3, and
generally absent in other samples. Samples other than CK-3 and CK-4
largely do not show melt infiltration along grain boundaries, instead
having major phases in contact (though many grain boundaries are fractured).
Clinopyroxene grains in all samples, but most notably CK-3 and CK-4,
are strongly intergrown with orthopyroxene.
Sample CK-7 shows abundant exsolution lamellae and graphic recrystallization of
orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene.

### Compositions of dominant phases

Major-element abundances for the peridotite xenoliths were measured
by electron microprobe using methods discussed in @sec:methods. Results
are summarized in @tbl:minerals and @fig:major_elements. Generally, phase compositions
show tight per-sample groupings, which suggest equilibrium within
samples.  The major silicate phases show Mg# > 87, consistent with
fertile or residual mantle compositions. Variation in Mg\#
between samples indicates differences in melt-extraction history between
the samples.

Silicate phases within CK-3 and CK-4 have Mg\#
distributions that suggest a residual composition, while the other
samples have more fertile compositions.
Samples CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7 cluster tightly in Fe-Mg space, with high
Mg\#s indicative of fertile compositions. Sample CK-6 has the lowest
Mg\#s, with values as low as 87 for clinopyroxenes. However, the sample
has high abundances of iron relative to the other fertile
peridotite samples, with olivine iron compositions ranging up to 8\%.

Spinel compositions give slightly more information on the modes of variation
between samples. For accuracy, we correct spinel Mg\# from total iron to ferrous iron basis using stoichiometric
balance: excess Fe is removed from the octahedral site and added to the tetrahedral
until $\Sigma \textrm{cations} = 3$ with a 4-oxygen basis. This correction results
in spinel Mg\# between 75 and 81, slightly higher than the uncorrected value.
Results are shown in @tbl:spinel_correction and @fig:spinel_cr.
Sample CK-2 has additional scatter imparted by this correction but the
rest seem to have homogeneous oxidized iron contents within-sample.
The residual samples (CK-3 and CK-4) show high Cr\# indicative of residues
of melt extraction, while the fertile samples show low Cr\#s. Sample CK-6 has an
intermediate Cr\# possibly indicative of a somewhat depleted sample and
related to its high iron content [Figure \ref{fig:major_elements}a].

The phase compositions of the "fertile" samples are quite consistent,
as are those of CK-3 and CK-4 (the more depleted samples). CK-6, with
silicate-phase signatures of enrichment combined with high-iron
compositions and chromian spinels, potentially demonstrates depletion
during partial melting followed by assimilation of a higher-iron enriching component.

### Modal mineralogy
<!--[[modes]]-->

The peridotite samples are lithologically classified using
recalculated whole-rock mineral modes.
Mineralogy was classified on a ~5000 pixel grid atop
coregistered optical scans and electron
backscatter mosaics [@fig:textures]. Volumetric modes were converted
to %wt using representative densities for spinel-facies
peridotite phases [@Nesse2000]. Results are shown in
@tbl:modal_mineralogy and @fig:modes.

The samples range from lherzolites to clinopyroxene
harzburgites and are dominated by olivine and orthopyroxene. All samples
contain minor (<1%wt) spinel. CK-2 has the most fertile
composition, with 12.2%wt clinopyroxene. CK-3 is the least
fertile sample, with 0.91%wt clinopyroxene. Weight percents derived from
olivine modes range from 65 to 75%. Grain size varies between samples but
generally has a characteristic scale of 200 µm. Some larger crystals are
evident -- the
harzburgite CK-3 contains 2 mm orthopyroxene
porphyroblasts. All samples are Type I peridotites in the @Frey1978
classification system.

### Whole-rock composition

Whole-rock major-element abundances are
reconstructed from averaged mineral composition and estimated modes.
Representative mineral and recalculated whole-rock compositions are
tabulated in @tbl:minerals.

Whole-rock Mg\# (molar Mg/(Mg+Fe) $\cdot$ 100) ranges from 87 to 91. Within each
sample, a consistent Mg\# for all silicate phases [@fig:major_elements] is indicative of Fe-Mg
equilibrium. All samples contain <1%wt spinel, which show
variation that mirrors that of the silicate phases. A range of
spinel Cr\# (molar Cr/(Cr+Al) $\cdot{}$ 100) from 10 to 27
implies variation in degree of partial melting between samples
[@Dick1984].

Samples CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7 have Mg# between 89 and 90 (both for individual
silicate phases and reconstructed whole-rock measurements). CK-3 and
CK-4 have higher Mg#, with whole-rock Mg# greater than 90. CK-6 has a
whole-rock Mg# < 88 and contains substantially
more Cr and Al than the other samples. Though CK-6 is generally the most
enriched in volatile elements, sample CK-2 contains
substantially more Ca and Na.

The coincident Mg# and low spinel Cr# of CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7 implies that they are
relatively fertile peridotites, with low melt volumes extracted.
The variation in whole-rock composition within these samples is due to a
change in the abundance of pyroxene phases, with sample CK-2 containing
substantially more pyroxene than CK-5.
The higher Mg# of samples CK-3 and CK-4 corresponds to their status as
residues of high-degree partial melting, which is also evident from their harzburgite
classification in modal mineralogy. For sample CK-6, the combination of high spinel Cr#
(implying depletion by partial melting) and low Mg# (a marker of
major-element fertility) suggests that this sample was impacted by a
multistage history of depletion and re-enrichment in major elements.
Assimilation of a more fractionated fluid might explain the higher iron
values as well as the high pyroxene modes, with pyroxene forming due to
the addition of silica to a more olivine-rich, residual component.
