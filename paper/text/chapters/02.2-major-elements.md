## Spinel peridotite xenoliths {#sec:xenoliths}

### Petrography

The spinel peridotite xenoliths (CK-2 through CK-7) are texturally classified
using the scheme of @Pike1977. All samples display a xenomorphic texture with
anisotropy largely absent. Most samples have minor plastic deformation
features, including slight kink bands in some olivine crystals. However, small
(~1º) axial rotations between large subgrain crystal domains
suggest little to no strain. Samples CK-2 and CK-5 exhibit a weak
shape-preferred alignment in elongate spinels [@fig:textures].

Minor late-stage alteration is seen in all peridotite samples. This includes
variably Fe-rich grain boundaries of major phases and Ti enrichment in pyroxene
rims (<10 µm from the grain edge). Sample CK-4 contains an thin melt channel
that cuts linearly across the thin section [@fig:textures]. This channel is
bounded by resorbed edges of the major phases (olivine and orthopyroxene) and
hosts microcrystalline clinopyroxene, 10 µm-scale euhedral spinels, and minor
amphibole. Near this melt channel, thin intergranular streamers are enriched in
Na and Ti. This grain-boundary melt infiltration is less extensive in sample
CK-3 and not present in other samples.

Clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene grains form interlocking crystal domains in all
samples. This is most apparent in CK-3 and CK-4, where sparse clinopyroxene is
always adjacent to orthopyroxene. Sample CK-7 shows minor exsolution lamellae
of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene. Peridotite fragments in CK-D1 show abundant
pyroxene exsolution lamellae [@fig:microscope-images|c], and sample CK-6 shows
similar vermicular pyroxene exsolution. CK-6 also contains unique composite
pyroxenes, with fused domains marked by substantially different crystal-axis
orientations.

### Compositions of dominant phases

Major-element abundances for the peridotite xenoliths were measured
by electron microprobe using methods discussed in @sec:methods. Results
are summarized in @tbl:composition|a and @fig:major_elements. Generally, phase compositions
show tight per-sample groupings, which suggest equilibrium within
each sample.  The major silicate phases show Mg# > 87, consistent with
fertile or residual mantle compositions. Variations in Mg\#
between samples indicate differences in melt-extraction and
refertilization history between the samples.

Samples CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7 cluster tightly in Fe-Mg space, with
relatively low Mg\#s indicative of fertile compositions
similar to average depleted
mantle [@Workman2005].
Silicate phases in CK-3 and CK-4 have Mg\# > 90, suggesting a
residual composition.
Sample CK-6 has low Mg\#s for all major phases, with values
as low as 87 for clinopyroxenes. All phases in this sample show higher
iron abundance than expected for fertile peridotites.

Based on measured phase composition, we correct spinel Mg\# from total iron to
ferrous iron basis using charge balance on a 4-oxygen basis. This correction
results in spinel Mg\# between 75 and 81, slightly higher than the uncorrected
value [@tbl:spinel_correction]. Some samples, particularly CK-2, have scatter
in corrected Mg# due to unmeasured transition metals (e.g. Zn, Co, V) that are
common in oxide minerals.  A range of spinel Cr\# (molar Cr/(Cr+Al) $\cdot{}$
100) from 10 for the fertile samples to 22-27 for CK-3 and CK-4 implies
variation in degree of partial melting. Sample CK-6 has an intermediate spinel
Cr\# [@fig:major_elements|c].

### Modal mineralogy

The spinel peridotite samples are dominated by olivine and orthopyroxene, and
quantitative modal abundances were measured by mapping phases on a 5000-point
grid atop coregistered optical scans and electron backscatter mosaics
[@fig:textures]. Volumetric modes were converted to wt. % using representative
densities for spinel-facies peridotite phases given in @Nesse2000
[@tbl:modal_mineralogy].

<!--[[[tbl:modal_mineralogy]]]-->

Modal abundance data shows a range in lithology from lherzolites to
clinopyroxene harzburgites [@fig:modes]. All samples contain minor (<1%)
spinel. The samples span a range of clinopyroxene content from 12.2% for the
fertile lherzolite CK-2 to 0.91%wt for the depleted harzburgite CK-3. The
harzburgites have larger grains (500 µm characteristic scale) than the
lherzolites (~200 µm), and CK-3 contains 2 mm orthopyroxene crystals. All
samples are Type I peridotites in the @Frey1978 classification system.

### Whole-rock composition

Whole-rock major-element abundances are
reconstructed from averaged mineral composition and estimated modes.
Representative mineral compositions are given in @tbl:composition|a, and
recalculated whole-rock compositions in @tbl:composition|c.
Whole-rock Mg\# ranges from 87 to 91. Within each
sample, a consistent Mg\# for all silicate phases [@fig:major_elements] is
indicative of Fe-Mg equilibrium. All samples contain <1%wt spinel, with Mg\#
variation mirroring that of the silicate phases.

Samples CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7 have Mg# between 89 and 90 (both for individual
silicate phases and reconstructed whole-rock measurements). CK-3 and CK-4 have
a whole-rock Mg# > 90. CK-6 has a whole-rock Mg# < 88 and contains
substantially more Cr, Al, and Fe than the other samples. Though CK-6 is
generally the most enriched in incompatible elements, sample CK-2 contains
somewhat more Ca and Na. Both of these samples have fertile major element
compositions.

### Discussion of peridotite composition

The coincident low Mg# and spinel Cr# of the lherzolite samples CK-2, CK-5, and
CK-7 implies that they are fertile to partially depleted peridotites, with low
melt volumes extracted (assuming no refertilization). These samples contain
consistently fertile phases (Mg# of ~89), with variation in whole-rock
composition coupled primarily to changing phase abundances: the samples show
a range in olivine abundance from 65 to 75%wt [@fig:modes] without adjustment
in equilibrium phase compositions, suggesting low to moderate levels of
depletion.

The harzburgite samples CK-3 and CK-4 contain high-Cr# spinels and high Mg# (>90)
silicate phases. These features, along with low (<2%) clinopyroxene modes, are
typical of residues of high-degree partial melting. The depleted phase
compositions and abundance of refractory Cr in spinel indicate almost-complete
removal of incompatible lithophile elements [@Dick1984].

CK-6 is a clear anomaly: high-iron phase compositions [@fig:major_elements|b],
low whole-rock Mg#, and high clinopyroxene modal abundances [@fig:modes] are
markers of fertility, but intermediate spinel Cr\# and abundant orthopyroxene
are typical of depleted residues. We propose a two-stage history, where the
highly fertile major-element composition of CK-6 was gained by assimilation of
a fractionated, Fe-rich melt into a partially depleted residue. In this case,
excess pyroxene would have formed due to the addition of silica to an
olivine-rich residual assemblage, and the relatively chromian spinels represent
a pre-refertilization vestige. We explore the potential depletion and
re-enrichment of these samples further in @sec:depletion-model.
