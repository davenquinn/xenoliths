## Major elements

Major-element compositions were
analyzed for each polished thin section on a five-spectrometer JEOL JXA-8200
electron-probe microanalyzer at the California Institute of Technology.
Abundances were counted in wavelength-dispersive mode using a probe
current of 15 kV. The instrument was calibrated using natural and
synthetic standards; matrix corrections were made using the CITZAF
[@Armstrong1988] algorithm. 1714 measurements were performed across the
six peridotite samples, concentrated in 3-4 locations of interest per
sample. Areas with orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in contact were emphasized to
aid in thermometry. 403 measurements of basaltic host and entrained dunites were also taken.

Electron backscatter intensity
images of each thin section were collected using a ZEISS 1550 VP field
emission SEM at the California Institute of Technology. These were
coregistered with optical scans and electron-microprobe analyses. <!--
TODO: should include these in supplementary material -->.
Minerals were automatically classified from microprobe data
using a nearest-neighbor fitting algorithm between pure endmember
phases. Poor-quality measurements with low totals were automatically
flagged using a scheme based on that of @Taylor1998, and mixed phases
along grain boundaries were discarded on a case-by-case basis.
The resulting classification was checked for consistency with optical
and backscatter imagery.

### Host lava

The Crystal Knob basalt contains abundant phenocrysts, including both
potassium and plagioclase feldspar.
A large population of clinopyroxene phenocrysts show an average Mg# of ~76.
A separate population of high-Mg# measurements (up to Mg# 91) are hosted
in xenolith fragments and relict cores of single grains.
Zoned clinopyroxene grains show a stepwise crystallization
history in a progressively evolving magma. The grain highlighted in
[@fig:cpx_profile] has a large core with Mg# ~90, but material with Mg# < 75
occurs only in the outermost 30 µm of the grain. This suggests that the
last phase of the magma's fractionation occurred relatively quickly,
perhaps as the flow cooled.

Major-element analysis of olivine phenocrysts in the
host lava shows
a well-sampled trendline from xenolith compositions (Mg#=0.89) through
progressively lower Mg# cumulate grains [@fig:major_elements].
Thus, olivine grains range from true phenocrysts to entrained
xenocrysts corresponding to the host peridotites
and cumulates from various intermediate stages of magma evolution.

Petrographic and mineral-composition features suggest that the Crystal
Knob material experienced a multiphase
history of fractional crystallization within deep magma chambers.
The Crystal Knob basalt contains fragments (both single-crystal
and lithic aggregates) corresponding to the mantle source and cumulates
from several stages of fractionation that were recycled into the magma.

### Peridotite xenoliths

<!-- Sample CK-4 is the most depleted, with a distinct signature of melt
extraction -->
<!-- TODO: more here!!! -->

We correct spinel Mg\# from total iron to ferrous iron basis using stoichiometric
balance: excess Fe is removed from the octahedral site and added to the tetrahedral
until $\Sigma \textrm{cations} = 3$ with a 4-oxygen basis. This correction results
in spinel Mg\# between 75 and 81, slightly higher than the uncorrected value.

The remainder of the sample-analytical techniques deployed query only
the harzburgite and lherzolite samples thought to sample the mantle
lithosphere column beneath the source of the Crystal Knob magma.

## Whole-rock mineralogy

### Modal mineralogy
<!--[[modes]]-->

The peridotite samples were lithologically classified using
recalculated whole-rock mineral modes.
Mineralogy was classified on a ~5000 pixel grid atop
coregistered optical scans and electron
backscatter mosaics [@fig:textures]. Volumetric modes were converted
to %wt using representative densities for spinel-facies
peridotite. Results are shown in @fig:modes.

The samples range from lherzolites to clinopyroxene
harzburgites and are dominated by olivine and orthopyroxene. All samples
contain minor (<1%wt) spinel. CK-2 has the most fertile
composition, with 12.2%wt clinopyroxene. CK-3 is the least
fertile sample, with 0.91%wt clinopyroxene. Olivine modes range
from 65 to 75%wt. Grain size varies between samples but
generally has a characteristic scale of 200 µm. The
harzburgite CK-3 contains 2 mm orthopyroxene
porphyroblasts. All samples are Type I peridotites in the @Frey1978
classification system.

### Whole-rock composition

Whole-rock major-element abundances are
reconstructed from averaged mineral composition and estimated modes.
Representative mineral and recalculated whole-rock compositions are
tabulated in @tab:minerals.

Whole-rock Mg\# (molar Mg/(Mg+Fe) $\cdot$ 100) ranges from 87 to 91. Within each
sample, a consistent Mg\# for all silicate phases [@fig:major_elements] is indicative of Fe-Mg
equilibrium. All samples contain <1%wt spinel, which show
variation that mirrors that of the silicate phases. A range of
spinel Cr\# (molar Cr/(Cr+Al) $\cdot{}$ 100) from 10 to 27
implies variation in degree of partial melting between samples
[@Dick1984].

Samples CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7 have Mg# between 89 and 90 (both for individual
silicate phases and reconstructed whole-rock measurements). CK-3 and
CK-4 have higher Mg#, with whole-rock Mg# greater than 90. CK-6,
meanwhile, has a whole-rock Mg# < 88. It also contains substantially
more Cr and Al than the other samples. Though CK-6 is generally the most
enriched in volatile elements, sample CK-2 contains
substantially more Ca and Na.

The coincident Mg# and low spinel Cr# of CK-2, CK-5, and CK-7 implies that they are
relatively fertile peridotites, with low melt volumes extracted.
The higher Mg# of samples CK-3 and CK-4 corresponds to their status as
residues of partial melting, which is also evident from their harzburgite
classification in modal mineralogy. For sample CK-6, the combination of high spinel Cr#
(implying depletion by partial melting) and low Mg# (a marker of
major-element fertility) suggests that this sample was impacted by a
multistage history of depletion and re-enrichment in major elements.
This pattern is not shared by any of the other samples in the dataset.
