## Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopes

<!--## Isotopes-->
Portions of each polyphase peridotite sample were crushed using
a shatterbox at the California Institute of Technology. Clinopyroxene
grains (150--300 Âµm, 35-45 g per sample and free of visible
inclusions and alteration) were picked by hand under a binocular
microscope. These clinopyroxene separates were analyzed for strontium
and neodymium isotopes at the University of Arizona, Tuscon. The samples were
spiked with mixed $^{147}$Sm-$^{150}$Nd tracers [@Wasserburg1981]. <comment>
Maybe some more info from Mihai?</comment> Samarium was analyzed using a
static routine on a 54 VG Sector multicollector thermal ionization mass
spectrometer (TIMS), and neodymium was measured as an oxide on a 354 VG
Sector instrument. Results are presented in `Table isotopes`.

Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd radiogenic isotope data for clinopyroxene separates show
these samples to be derived from the depleted convecting mantle. 
All xenolith samples are enriched in radiogenic \ce{^{143}Nd}
($\epsilon_{\textrm{Nd}}$ from 10.3 to 11.0) and depleted in
\ce{^{87}Sr} (\ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .702). This pattern of strong
depletion in large-ion-lithophile elements rules out a continental
lithosphere or Mesozoic mantle wedge source and suggests an origin in the
asthenospheric or underplated oceanic mantle
[@DePaolo1976b;@McCulloch1978].
