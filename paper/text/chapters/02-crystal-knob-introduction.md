# Crystal Knob xenolith locality

The Crystal Knob volcanic neck (35.806º N, 121.174º W) is a mid-Pleistocene
olivine--plagioclase phyric basalt that erupted along the margin of the
Franciscan assemblage 500 m west of the Nacimiento Fault in the Santa Lucia
Mountains of central California [@Seiders1989]. It was described in
@Wilshire1988 but not studied in detail. The basaltic plug is ~80 m in diameter
at the surface and has entrained abundant dunite and sparse spinel peridotite
xenoliths [@fig:field_photo]. The dunites have textural features typical of
igneous cumulates, and olivine aggregates decrease in size to single grain
xenocrysts, which are visually indistinguishable from phenocrysts in the basalt
groundmass. Sparse spinel peridotites, lacking textures suggestive of cumulate
origin, are also present. In conjunction with the compositional data presented
below, we interpret the peridotites as entrained fragments of the mantle
lithosphere.

Samples were collected from the Crystal Knob lava with an
emphasis on these polyphase peridotite xenoliths. Xenolith samples are 5-10 cm
diameter friable peridotites with 200 µm -- 1 mm grains. Additionally, samples
of the host basalt and dunite cumulates were collected to establish context for
the xenoliths.
