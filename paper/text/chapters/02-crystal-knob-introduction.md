# Crystal Knob xenolith locality

The Crystal Knob volcanic neck (35.806º N, 121.174º W) is a mid-Pleistocene
olivine--plagioclase phyric basalt which erupted along the margin of the
Franciscan assemblage 500 m west of the Nacimiento Fault in the Santa Lucia
Mountains of central California [@Seiders1989]. The basaltic plug is ~80
m in diameter at the surface and has entrained abundant dunite and sparse
spinel peridotite xenoliths `[Figure field_photo]`. The dunites are cumulates, and
texturally they grade into single grain xenocrysts, or the apparent
phenocrysts, for the host lava. The spinel peridotites are volumetrically
subordinate to the dunites. As discussed below, the peridotites lack textural
features suggestive of igneous cumulate origin, and in conjunction with the
compositional data presented below we interpret the peridotites as mantle
lithosphere in origin.

Samples were collected from the Crystal Knob lava with an
emphasis on volumetrically minor polyphase peridotite xenoliths.
Xenolith samples are 5-10 cm diameter friable peridotites with medium (200 µm -- 1 mm)
grains. However, several samples of the host basalt and dunite cumulates were
collected to establish context for the xenoliths.

## Eruptive age

The ages of host lavas for mantle xenolith suites are critical for the
application of their petrogenesis to tectonic and geodynamic processes
(for example, see @Ducea1998b).
The age of the Crystal Knob host lava was determined
using the \ce{$^{40}$Ar}/\ce{$^{39}$Ar} radioisotope technique. A billet
of the host lava (sample CK-1) containing visible plagioclase
phenocrysts was provided to the USGS Geochronology
Laboratory in Denver, Colorado. The sample was irradiated in the USGS
TRIGA reactor, and plagioclase feldspar grains were step-heated *in situ*
using an infrared laser `[Figure step_heating]`, and $^{39}$Ar loss was
measured simultaneously on a Thermo Scientific Argus VI using 4 Faraday
detectors (m/e 40-37) and ion counting (m/e 36). The detectors were
intercalibrated using standard gas and air pipettes. The measurements
are corrected for blanks above baselines, radioactive decay, and
nucleogenic interferences, and standardized against a Fish Canyon
sanidine with an age of 28.20 Ma. Non-radiogenic argon is assumed to have
an atmospheric composition (\ce{$^{40}$Ar}/\ce{$^{39}$Ar} = 298.56) [@Cosca2011].

Data for stepwise heating are presented in `Table step_heating_table`
and shown graphically in `Figure step_heating`.
Our preferred age of 1.65±0.06 Ma is defined
by the twelve intermediate out of fifteen heating steps, for which the
entire spectrum define a similar age, within error, of 1.71 Ma. From
these age data we infer that the xenoliths were entrained
from the upper mantle directly underlying the Crystal
Knob volcanic pipe during the mid-Pleistocene, at ca. 1.65 Ma.
