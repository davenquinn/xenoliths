# Crystal Knob xenolith locality

The Crystal Knob volcanic neck (35.806º N, 121.174º W) is a mid-Pleistocene
olivine--plagioclase phyric basalt that erupted along the margin of the
Franciscan assemblage 500 m west of the Nacimiento Fault in the Santa Lucia
Mountains of central California [@Seiders1989]. It was briefly described in
@Wilshire1988 but not studied in detail. The basaltic plug is ~80
m in diameter at the surface and has entrained abundant dunite and sparse
spinel peridotite xenoliths [@fig:field_photo]. The dunites are cumulates, and
grade texturally into single grain xenocrysts, or apparent
phenocrysts, within the host lava. Sparse spinel
peridotites are also present which lack textural
features suggestive of igneous cumulate origin. In conjunction with the
compositional data presented below, we interpret the peridotites as
entrained fragments of the mantle lithosphere.

Samples were collected from the Crystal Knob lava with an
emphasis on these polyphase peridotite xenoliths.
Xenolith samples are 5-10 cm diameter friable peridotites with medium (200 µm -- 1 mm)
grains. Additionally, several samples of the host basalt and dunite cumulates were
collected to establish context for the xenoliths.

## Eruptive age

The ages of host lavas for mantle xenolith suites are critical for the
application of their petrogenesis to tectonic and geodynamic processes
[e.g. @Ducea1998b].
The age of the Crystal Knob host lava was determined
using the \ce{$^{40}$Ar}/\ce{$^{39}$Ar} technique on phenocryst
plagioclase. A billet
of the host lava (sample CK-1) containing visible plagioclase
lathes was provided to the USGS Geochronology
Laboratory in Denver, Colorado. The sample was irradiated in the USGS
TRIGA reactor, and plagioclase feldspar grains were step-heated *in situ*
using an infrared laser [@fig:step_heating]. \ce{$^{39}$Ar} loss was
measured simultaneously on a Thermo Scientific Argus VI using 4 Faraday
detectors (m/e 40-37) and ion counting (m/e 36). The detectors were
intercalibrated using standard gas and air pipettes. The measurements
are corrected for blanks above baselines, radioactive decay, and
nucleogenic interferences, and standardized against a Fish Canyon
sanidine with an age of 28.20 Ma. Non-radiogenic argon is assumed to have
an atmospheric composition of \ce{$^{40}$Ar}/\ce{$^{39}$Ar} = 298.56 [@Cosca2011].

Step-heating data are presented in @tbl:step_heating_table
and shown graphically in @fig:step_heating.
Our preferred age of 1.65±0.06 Ma is defined
by the twelve intermediate out of fifteen heating steps. The
entire spectrum defines a similar age, within error, of 1.71 Ma. From
these ages we infer that the xenoliths were entrained
from the upper mantle directly underlying the Crystal
Knob volcanic pipe during the mid-Pleistocene, at ca. 1.65 Ma.
