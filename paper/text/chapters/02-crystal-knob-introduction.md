# Crystal Knob xenolith locality

The Crystal Knob volcanic neck (35.806º N, 121.174º W) is a mid-Pleistocene
olivine--plagioclase phyric basalt which erupted along the margin of the
Franciscan assemblage 500 m west of the Nacimiento Fault in the Santa Lucia
Mountains of central California [@Seiders1989]. The basaltic plug is ~80
m in diameter at the surface and has entrained abundant dunite and sparse
spinel peridotite xenoliths `[Figure field_photo]`. The dunites are cumulates, and
texturally they grade into single grain xenocrysts, or the apparent
phenocrysts, for the host lava. The spinel peridotites are volumetrically
subordinate to the dunites. As discussed below, the peridotites lack textural
features suggestive of igneous cumulate origin, and in conjunction with the
compositional data presented below we interpret the peridotites as mantle
lithosphere in origin.

Samples were collected from the Crystal Knob lava with an
emphasis on volumetrically minor polyphase peridotite xenoliths.
Xenolith samples
were 5-10 cm diameter friable peridotites with medium (200 µm -- 1 mm)
grains. However, several samples of the host basalt and dunite cumulates were
collected to establish context for the xenoliths.

## Eruptive age

The ages of host lavas for mantle xenolith suites are critical for the
application of their petrogenesis to tectonic and geodynamic processes
(for example, see @Ducea1998b).
The age of the Crystal Knob host lava was determined
using the $^{40}$Ar/$^{39}$Ar radioisotope technique. A billet
of the host lava (sample CK-1) containing visible plagioclase
phenocrysts was provided to the USGS Geochronology
Laboratory in Denver, Colorado. The sample was irradiated in the USGS
TRIGA reactor, and plagioclase feldspar grains were step-heated *in situ* using an infrared laser `[Figure step_heating]`, and $^{39}$Ar loss was
measured simultaneously on a Thermo Scientific Argus VI using 4 Faraday
detectors (m/e 40-37) and ion counting (m/e 36). The detectors were
intercalibrated using standard gas and air pipettes. The measurements
are corrected for blanks above baselines, radioactive decay, and
nucleogenic interferences, and standardized against a Fish Canyon
sanidine with an age of 28.20 Ma. Non-radiogenic argon is assumed to have
an atmospheric composition ($^{40}$Ar/$^{39}$Ar = 298.56) [@Cosca2011].

Data for stepwise heating are presented in `Table step_heating_table`
and shown graphically in `Figure step_heating`.
Our preferred age of 1.65±0.06 Ma is defined
by the twelve intermediate out of fifteen heating steps, for which the
entire spectrum define a similar age, within error, of 1.71 Ma. From
these age data we infer that the xenoliths were entrained
from the upper mantle directly underlying the Crystal
Knob volcanic pipe at ca. 1.7 Ma,
or mid-Pleistocene time.

## Petrography

Polished thin sections of 250 µm thickness were
prepared for six peridotite xenolith samples
(CK-2 through CK-7) and the basaltic host lava (CK-1). The
xenolith samples were bound with epoxy prior to sectioning.
Large-format rectangular thin sections were prepared for two lava samples dominated
by dunite cumulate fragments (CK-D1 and CK-D2).
The samples were evaluated under a petrographic microscope to determine
their textural and mineralogic variation.

### Host lava

The host lava (CK-1) is an alkali basalt with sparse vesicles and abundant phenocrysts of plagioclase and
olivine, and less common clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene.
The sample also contain dunite and multiphase peridotite fragments
ranging from aggregates of a few grains to ~5 cm diameter.

The groundmass is dominated by altered glass and microcrystalline
plagioclase lathes.
Though dominantly black, it is mottled with slightly greenish grey color domains
at ~500 mm scale, which likely correspond to different levels of alteration.
These domains are cross-cut by elongate narrow (~1 mm) flow shear bands of
finer-grained material with sparse vesicles and phenocrysts.

Petrographic study of cumulate fragments within the Crystal Knob
basalt reveals residues from multiple stages of melt fractionation.
Samples CK-D1 and CK-D2 are dominated
by dunite and peridotite fragments up to 2 cm in diameter. The
peridotite fragments show textures similar to those in samples CK-2 to CK-7.
The dunites fragments are cumulate textured and finer-grained than the peridotites,
with characteristic grain sizes ranging from 50--200 µm for different fragments.
Intergranular melt inclusions <!-- now altered to ??? -->
are evident between olivine grains. Some cumulate material surrounds large (up to
2 mm) grains of olivine, spinel, and pyroxene (or multigrain aggregates of
these phases). CK-D1 notably contains a large spinel grain with a
pitted rim embedded in dunite.
The dunite cumulates in these samples are texturally representative of
the vast majority of xenoliths Crystal Knob basalt.

Overall, the Crystal Knob basalt contains fragments (both single-crystal
and lithic aggregates) corresponding to the mantle source and cumulates
from several stages of fractionation that were recycled into the magma.
<!-- This suggests evolution in several
deep magma chambers with entrainment of the wall rock

Taken together, these samples appear to
represent interactions with the melt throughout their history -->

### Xenoliths

<!-- (Daven, we should have a table that lists all samples, and gives a
petrographic overview) -->

The peridotite samples (CK-2 through CK-7) were texturally classified using
the scheme of @Pike1977. All samples display an allotriomorphic granular
texture with anisotropy largely absent. There are
no significant petrographically observed plastic deformation features
(e.g. kink domains in olivine grains) in any of the samples. However,
samples CK-2 and CK-5 exhibit a weak shape-preferred alignment in elongate
spinels.

Minor late-stage alteration products are seen in all peridotite samples.
This includes variably Fe-rich grain boundaries of major phases and Ti
enrichment in pyroxene rims (<10 µm from the grain
edge). Sample CK-4 contains an alteration channel which cuts linearly
across the thin section. This channel is bounded by resorbed boundaries
of the major phases (olivine and orthopyroxene) and hosts
microcrystalline clinopyroxene, 10 µm euhedral spinels,
and minor amphibole. Near this melt channel, thin streamers of
intergranular fill show compositions enriched in Na and Ti. These
fills are present (but less extensive) in sample CK-3, and
generally absent in other samples. Samples other than CK-3 and CK-4
largely do not show melt infiltration along grain boundaries, instead
having major phases in contact (though most are fractured along these surfaces).
All samples, but most notably CK-3 and CK-4, have clinopyroxene grains
that are strongly intergrown with orthopyroxene. <!-- check this
statement -->
Sample CK-7 shows abundant exsolution lamellae and graphic recrystallization of
orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene.


Major-element compositions were
analyzed for each polished thin section on a five-spectrometer JEOL JXA-8200
electron-probe microanalyzer at the California Institute of Technology.
Abundances were counted in wavelength-dispersive mode using a probe
current of 15 kV. The instrument was calibrated using natural and
synthetic standards; matrix corrections were made using the CITZAF
[@Armstrong1988] algorithm. 1714 measurements were performed across the
six peridotite samples, concentrated in 3-4 locations of interest per
sample. 403 measurements of basaltic host and entrained dunites were also taken.

Areas with orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in contact were emphasized to
aid in thermometry. Minerals were classified from the analytical data
using a nearest-neighbor fitting algorithm between pure endmember
phases. Poor-quality measurements with low totals were automatically
flagged using a scheme based on that of @Taylor1998, and mixed phases
along grain boundaries were manually discarded.

Whole-rock major-element abundances are
reconstructed from averaged mineral composition and estimated modes.
Representative mineral and recalculated whole-rock compositions are
tabulated in `Table minerals`.

<!-- ## SIMS -->
Trace element concentrations were acquired for pyroxene grains
in each xenolith sample,
using a Cameca IMS-7f-GEO magnetic-sector secondary ion mass
spectrometer (SIMS) at the California Institute of Technology. Two to
three each of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene grains were targeted per
xenolith sample. Measurements were acquired with 9 kV beam flux and a
100 µm spot size. The USGS glass standard NIST 610 was used as an
external standard for all elements [@Gao2002]<!-- this ref is for
LA-ICP-MS -->. Minimal variation in measured concentration was observed
at grain and sample scale, though clinopyroxene in CK-6 and
orthopyroxene in CK-7 show differences outside of analytical error in
Ba, La, and Ce (potentially attributable to concentrations near SIMS
detection limits). Other measurements are largely concordant and results
are presented as within-sample averages. Whole-rock trace element
abundances are estimated using measured concentrations in clinopyroxene
and orthopyroxene and mineral modes. Olivine is ignored in calculations
because rare-earth elements (REEs) are 2-3 orders of magnitude less
compatible than in clinopyroxene [@WittEickschen2005;@Luffi2009].
Results for measured pyroxene and recalculated whole-rock trace elements
are shown in `Table trace_elements`.

<!--## Isotopes-->
Portions of each peridotite sample were crushed using
a shatterbox at the California Institute of Technology. Clinopyroxene
grains (150--300 µm, 35-45 g per sample and free of visible
inclusions and alteration) were picked by hand under a binocular
microscope. These clinopyroxene separates were analyzed for strontium
and neodymium isotopes at the University of Arizona, Tuscon. The samples were
spiked with mixed $^{147}$Sm-$^{150}$Nd tracers [@Wasserburg1981]. <!--
Maybe some more info from Mihai? --> Samarium was analyzed using a
static routine on a 54 VG Sector multicollector thermal ionization mass
spectrometer (TIMS), and neodymium was measured as an oxide on a 354 VG
Sector instrument. Results are presented in `Table isotopes`.
