## Geochemical variation with depth and temperature {#sec:PT-geochemical-variation}

The Crystal Knob peridotite xenoliths studied here
are uniformly isotopically depleted, with an
$\epsilon_\mathrm{Nd}$ of +10.3-11.0,
and \ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .7023-.7024.
These are closely related to values found in the
depleted upper mantle [e.g. @Hofmann1997] and require a
mantle source that has seen no contribution from the western
North American subcontinental mantle or continental lithosphere more generally.
The mantle lithosphere sampled by the Crystal Knob suite matches slightly depleted
convective mantle material and is unrelated to the overlying continental
crust. However, the xenoliths can be divided both along chemical lines
and by their equilibration temperature.
The two temperature cohorts seem to sample mantle material
with somewhat different major- and trace-element characteristics.
Integrating depth constraints derived from geothermal data and Ca-in-olivine
geobarometry, we can note the pattern of xenolith chemistry with depth.

The low-temperature and shallower cohort includes phases
with relatively fertile compositions in both major and trace elements.
The samples have phase compositions similar to depleted MORB
mantle [@Workman2005], and clinopyroxene trace elements
range from essentially undepleted to low levels of depletion
characteristic of the least-depleted abyssal peridotites
[@fig:trace_elements].

The high-temperature, deeper samples show two distinct sets of chemical characteristics.
Samples CK-3 and CK-4 are characterized by phases with high Mg\#s, suggesting that
all phases lost incompatible elements during high-degree depletion. These features,
along with high levels of REE depletion, extremely low
clinopyroxene modes, and chromian spinels, indicate significant melt extraction.
Distinct enrichments in LREE likely correspond to assimilation of a fractionated melt,
though this is modeled to be volumetrically insignificant.

Sample CK-6, the hottest and deepest sample, has a highly fertile major-element composition.
However, high modal abundance of pyroxenes and spinel, and simultaneously elevated
Cr, Al, and LREE suggest a history including both significant depletion and re-enrichment.
This is bolstered by petrographic evidence of significant
intergrowth and aggregation of pyroxene grains, unique in the sample set.
Elevated REE-in-two-pyroxene temperatures for samples CK-4 and CK-6
suggest a fossil heating event not shown in major-element thermometry.
This event may have been more completely felt by sample CK-6, which has a fully
equilibrated REE temperature measurement [@fig:ree_temperature] and
appears to have assimilated a sizable amount of enriched material.

Altogether, the pattern of increasing depletion with depth suggests
increased melt extraction deeper in the lithospheric column, over a
<10 km depth range (given reasonable geothermal gradients). However,
variation in depletion over a small depth range (anchored by similar
equilibration temperatures) suggest some heterogeneity to melting.
This pattern is at odds with the expected signature of decompression
melting, which implies monotonically increasing melting degrees at shallower depths.
@Luffi2009 found a similar inverted pattern within mantle lithosphere
packages beneath Dish Hill, ascribing fertile lherzolites at the
top of the package to refertilization of suboceanic mantle lithosphere.

Wholesale refertilization seems unlikely for the Crystal Knob sample set due to the consistency of
phase abundances with major and
trace-element chemistry within all samples except CK-6. The presence of this
obviously refertilized sample at the base of the column, along with harzburgites
at similar depths, suggests melt-rock interactions that were most intense at
deep levels.
This spatial pattern is commonly associated with flux melting in subarc settings [e.g. @Jean2010]
but could also arise from intense heating from below [@Thorkelson2005].
We now turn to the tectonic constraints on the structure of the mantle
lithosphere beneath coastal southern California, which provide a
framework in which to consider this deep lithospheric geochemical and thermal
structure.
