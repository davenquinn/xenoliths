## Geochemical variation within the Crystal Knob sample set

All of the Crystal Knob xenoliths analyzed are isotopically depleted, with an
initial $\epsilon_\mathrm{Nd}$ of +10.3-11.0,
and \ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .7023-.7024.
These are closely related to values found in the
depleted upper mantle [e.g. @Hofmann1997] and require a
mantle source that has seen no contribution from the western
North American subcontinental mantle or continental lithosphere more generally.
The mantle lithosphere sampled by the Crystal Knob suite was created
from the same convective mantle reservoir and is distinct from the overlying
crustal material.
However, the two temperature cohorts seem to sample mantle material
with somewhat different major- and trace-element characteristics.

The low-temperature cohort includes phases
with relatively fertile compositions in both major and trace elements.
The samples have phase compositions similar to depleted MORB
mantle [@Workman2005], and clinopyroxene trace element patterns
range from essentially undepleted to low levels of depletion
characteristic of the least-depleted abyssal peridotites
[@fig:trace_elements].

The high-temperature samples show major-element compositions with lower
Mg\#s, suggesting that depletion progressed further, with all phases
losing incompatible elements. Within this cohort, CK-3 and
CK-4 show significantly higher levels of REE depletion and extremely low
clinopyroxene modes, as well as distinct enrichments in clinopyroxene
LREEs, which likely correspond to assimilation of enriching fluid and
are notably different from profiles found in abyssal peridotites
[@fig:trace_elements; @fig:ree_model]. They also contain chromian spinels,
which indicate significant melt extraction.

Phases within sample CK-6 show uniformly low Mg\#s, suggesting
enrichment. However, high modal abundance of pyroxene
phases suggests some amount of major-element re-enrichment after
formation. This is bolstered by petrographic evidence of significant
growth and aggregation of pyroxene grains, unique in the sample set. It is
relatively undepleted in REEs and shows no significant temperature
disequilibrium in any thermometer including REE. This major-element
refertilization is likely a result of basaltic liquid addition
and subsolidus re-equilibration. It implies significant mass
exchange and may be due to interaction with deep upwelling fluids.
<comment>This paragraph should make clear that CK-6 first underwent depletion
given HREEs and spinel Cr, and was then re-enriched by assimilating a substantial
quantity of evolved melt</comment>

Broadly, the results of geochemical and thermometric studies of the
Crystal Knob suite suggest that the mantle lithosphere beneath central
California was affected by differing levels of depletion and
re-enrichment. The shallower samples are less depleted, and the hottest
and deepest samples are melt residues, implying more melt extraction at
deeper levels of the lithospheric column. Modeling suggests that
re-enrichment happened throughout the sample set, and all clinopyroxene
rare-earth elements show effects of re-enrichment except for CK-2.
Disequilibrium in REE (CK-4) and unusual major element
signatures (CK-6) occur in the hotter samples. This suggests that these
samples were affected by melt-rock interactions that were the most intense
towards the bottom of the lithosphere,
sometime in their post-emplacement<comment>?</comment> and pre-eruptive history.
<comment>need to reformulate without depths or just discuss after the depth
data are developed. Also:
- Depletion gradient is inverse what you get from decompression melting
- More like what you get from flux melting above a slab due to fluid influx

<comment>Peter:
Wouldn't be a T vs. F plot useful here? This pattern resembles DH, in which case we proposed that top is fertile because of refertilization. This is what you think about CK, too? If yes, be sure to state this clearly; if no, how does this pattern fit with your pMELTS model (adiabatic decompression melting)? In any case: try to reformulate to reflect more precisely your option.
