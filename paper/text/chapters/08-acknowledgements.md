\section*{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank M. Cosca and the USGS Argon geochronology
laboratory for their assistance with dating the Crystal Knob basalt flow. J.
Blundy and M. Gurnis were valuable resources on REE thermometry and geodynamic
modeling, respectively. F. Sousa and J. Price encouraged consideration of the
wider tectonic context. We would also like to thank A. Chapman, E.
Nadin, and one anonymous reviewer for their excellent feedback, which
greatly improved this contribution. This work was supported
