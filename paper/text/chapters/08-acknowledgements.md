\section*{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank M. Cosca and the USGS Argon geochronology
laboratory for their assistance with dating the Crystal Knob
basalt flow. P. Asimow supported key microanalysis and provided
valuable petrological feedback. J. Blundy and M. Gurnis were valuable
resources on REE thermometry and geodynamic modeling, respectively.
F. Sousa and J. Price encouraged consideration of the wider tectonic
context that greatly improved this work.
