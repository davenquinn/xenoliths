\section*{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank M. Cosca and the USGS argon geochronology
laboratory for their assistance with dating the Crystal Knob
basalt flow. P. Asimow supported key microanalysis and provided
valuable petrological feedback. J. Blundy and M. Gurnis were a valuable
resource on REE thermometry and geodynamical modeling, respectively.
F. Sousa and J. Price encouraged consideration of the wider geologic
context that greatly improved this work.
