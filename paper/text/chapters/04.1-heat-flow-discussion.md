## Synthesizing xenolith and heat-flow constraints on the geotherm

Detailed studies of heat flow of the western U.S. [@Erkan2008; @Erkan2009]
based on borehole measurements of heat flux in wells > 100 m deep
show high (60-90 mW/m^2) heat flow measurements in the entire Coast Range belt.
These workers assign the central California coast within the "Coast Range Thermal Anomaly"
(CRTA) of high surface heat flux measurements. This CRTA is characterized by
.
In the maps of heat flow presented in @Erkan2008 and @Erkan2009,
the heat flow values in the coast ranges starkly contrast
with low heat flows observed in the adjacent Great Valley,
and in the Sierra Nevada. However, these values are relatively
similar to those measured in the Mojave province.


These regional heat flow
measurements are likely to be maximum estimates of the regionally-averaged heat
flow and geothermal gradient due to several factors including the possibility
of localized uplift, highly radiogenic crust near the surface (e.g. the
Salinian granodiorites and tonalites), and regional heat diffusion by fluid
circulation within the San Andreas fault zone.

, areas
underlain by intact batholithic exposures have relatively
low heat flow values (e.g. the Sierra Nevada and Central Valley,
the Peninsular Ranges, and the Santa Lucia range)

Measurements of surface heat flux for coastal California

- Can we estimate depth from these heat flow data?
- Can we estimate thermal relaxation based on the heat flow data?
  - @Erkan2008 attempts to differentiate between a stalled slab
    and slab window scenario

### Potential for thermal disequilibrium

A key problem in estimating
geothermal gradients from the surface heat flux is understanding the
physical properties that govern the mantle lithosphere material.

However, the surface temperatures that the heat flow
data are based on may be transient.

Regionally averaged continental surface heat flows typically range from
lows of 20 mW/m^2 in cratonic cores to 120 mW/m^2 in focused areas of
active mantle upwelling (e.g. the southern Salton Trough)
[@Pollack1977; @Erkan2009].

### Heat flow data

The Coast Ranges are geologically active and may be affected by
geothermal and erosional processes. Recent increases in erosion such as
those documented post 2 Ma in the Santa Lucia Range [@Ducea2003b]
could significantly raise the geothermal gradient in the Coast Ranges.
Over longer timescales, the inward stepping of the transverse plate
boundary to the San Andreas fault zone has generated significant
shortening and uplift in the Coast Ranges since the Miocene
[@Dickinson2005].

The geothermal gradient may be affected by regional differences in
thermal conductivity, which can be enhanced by hydrothermal circulation
in the presence of fractures.
@Lachenbruch1980 concluded that CRTA could not be generated by
conductive fault heating alone, but was also hesitant to invoke fluid
flow to explain a regionally averaged thermal gradient.
@Kennedy1997 shows the presence of mantle fluids in the San Andreas
fault zone, giving credence to the idea deep fluid transport.

All of these potential estimation effects for a geothermal gradient have
the effect of making it look more pronounced than it really is. Thus, it
seems likely that the gradients shown are a maximum limit on allowed
geothermal gradient.



The eruption of Crystal Knob itself demonstrates that a fully conductive
geotherm is unreasonable, as at least *some* heat was advected to the
surface by this and other volcanic fields.
