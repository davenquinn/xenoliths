# Crystal Knob

The Crystal Knob volcanic neck (35.806º N, 121.174º W) is a mid-Pleistocene
olivine--plagioclase phyric basalt which erupted along the margin of the
Franciscan assemblage 500 m west of the Nacimiento Fault in the Santa Lucia
Mountains of central California [@Seiders1989]. The basaltic plug is ~80
m in diameter at the surface and has entrained abundant dunite and sparse
spinel peridotite xenoliths `[Figure field_photo]`. The dunites are cumulates, and
texturally they grade into single grain xenocrysts, or the apparent
phenocrysts, for the host lava. The spinel peridotites are volumetrically
subordinate to the dunites. As discussed below, the peridotites lack textural
features suggestive of igneous cumulate origin, and in conjunction with the
compositional data presented below we interpret the peridotites as mantle
lithosphere in origin.

## Eruptive age

The ages of host lavas for mantle xenolith suites are critical for the
application of their petrogenesis to tectonic and geodynamic processes
(for example, see @Ducea1998b).
The age of the Crystal Knob host lava was determined
using the $^{40}$Ar/$^{39}$Ar radioisotope technique on in situ <!--?--> 
plagioclase phenocrysts. A billet
of the host lava (sample CK-1) was provided to the USGS Geochronology
Laboratory in Denver, Colorado. Plagioclase feldspar grains
were selected from the sample and irradiated in the USGS TRIGA reactor.
The samples were
step-heated using an infrared laser `[Figure step_heating]`, and $^{39}$Ar loss was
measured simultaneously on a Thermo Scientific Argus VI using 4 Faraday
detectors (m/e 40-37) and ion counting (m/e 36). The detectors were
intercalibrated using standard gas and air pipettes. The measurements
are corrected for blanks above baselines, radioactive decay, and
nucleogenic interferences, and standardized against a Fish Canyon
sanidine with an age of 28.20 Ma. Non-radiogenic argon is assumed to have
an atmospheric composition ($^{40}$Ar/$^{39}$Ar = 298.56) [@Cosca2011].

Data for stepwise heating are presented in `Table step_heating_table`
and shown graphically in `Figure step_heating`.
Our preferred age of 1.65±0.06 Ma is defined
by the twelve intermediate out of fifteen heating steps, for which the
entire spectrum define a similar age, within error, of 1.71 Ma. From
these age data we infer that the xenoliths were entrained
from the upper mantle directly underlying the Crystal
Knob volcanic pipe at ca. 1.7 Ma,
or mid-Pleistocene time.

Methods
=======

Samples were collected from the Crystal Knob volcanic neck with an
emphasis on volumetrically minor polyphase peridotite xenoliths. Samples
were 5-10 cm diameter friable peridotites with medium (200 µm -- 1 mm)
grains. Several samples of the host basalt and dunite cumulates were
collected as well.

Polished thin sections of 250 µm thickness were
prepared for six peridotite xenolith samples
(CK-2 through CK-7) and the basaltic host lava (CK-1). The
xenolith samples were bound with epoxy prior to sectioning.
Large-format rectangular thin sections were prepared for two lava samples dominated
by dunite cumulate fragments (CK-D1 and CK-D2).

The samples were evaluated under a petrographic microscope to determine
their textural and mineralogic variation. Electron backscatter intensity
images were collected using a ZEISS 1550 VP field emission SEM. For each
peridotite sample, modal mineralogy was estimated by classifying mineralogy on a
\~5000 pixel grid atop coregistered optical scans and electron
backscatter mosaics `[Figure textures]`. Volumetric modes were converted
to %wt using representative densities for spinel-facies
peridotite. <!--Maybe show these densities? --> Results are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:modes}. <!--Should make a table about this-->

<!-- ## Electron microprobe --> Major-element mineral compositions were
analyzed for each polished thin section on a five-spectrometer JEOL JXA-8200
electron-probe microanalyzer at the California Institute of Technology.
Abundances were counted in wavelength-dispersive mode using a probe
current of 15 kV. The instrument was calibrated using natural and
synthetic standards; matrix corrections were made using the CITZAF
[@Armstrong1988] algorithm. 1714 measurements were performed across the
six peridotite samples, concentrated in 3-4 locations of interest per
sample. <!-- 403 measurements of dunites and the basalt host were also taken,
but are not reported in this study. -->
Areas with orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in contact were emphasized to
aid in thermometry. Whole-rock major-element abundances are
reconstructed from mineral composition and estimated modes.
Representative mineral and recalculated whole-rock compositions are
tabulated in `Table minerals`.

<!-- ## SIMS -->
Trace element concentrations were acquired for pyroxene grains
in each xenolith sample,
using a Cameca IMS-7f-GEO magnetic-sector secondary ion mass
spectrometer (SIMS) at the California Institute of Technology. Two to
three each of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene grains were targeted per
xenolith sample. Measurements were acquired with 9 kV beam flux and a
100 µm spot size. The USGS glass standard NIST 610 was used as an
external standard for all elements [@Gao2002]<!-- this ref is for
LA-ICP-MS -->. Minimal variation in measured concentration was observed
at grain and sample scale, though clinopyroxene in CK-6 and
orthopyroxene in CK-7 show differences outside of analytical error in
Ba, La, and Ce (potentially attributable to concentrations near SIMS
detection limits). Other measurements are largely concordant and results
are presented as within-sample averages. Whole-rock trace element
abundances are estimated using measured concentrations in clinopyroxene
and orthopyroxene and mineral modes. Olivine is ignored in calculations
because rare-earth elements (REEs) are 2-3 orders of magnitude less
compatible than in clinopyroxene [@WittEickschen2005;@Luffi2009].
Results for measured pyroxene and recalculated whole-rock trace elements
are shown in `Table trace_elements`.

<!--## Isotopes-->
Portions of each peridotite sample were crushed using
a shatterbox at the California Institute of Technology. Clinopyroxene
grains (150--300 µm, 35-45 g per sample and free of visible
inclusions and alteration) were picked by hand under a binocular
microscope. These clinopyroxene separates were analyzed for strontium
and neodymium isotopes at the University of Arizona, Tuscon. The samples were
spiked with mixed $^{147}$Sm-$^{150}$Nd tracers [@Wasserburg1981]. <!--
Maybe some more info from Mihai? --> Samarium was analyzed using a
static routine on a 54 VG Sector multicollector thermal ionization mass
spectrometer (TIMS), and neodymium was measured as an oxide on a 354 VG
Sector instrument. Results are presented in `Table isotopes`.
