The Pleistocene (1.65 Ma) Crystal Knob volcanic neck in the California
Coast Ranges is an olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt containing dunite
and spinel peridotite xenoliths.
The peridotites sample the mantle lithosphere beneath the
Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan complex and crystalline
nappes of the "Salinia terrane," which together form
the exhumed remnants of the southern California
Cretaceous subducting margin.
Crystal Knob adds a new continental-margin constraint
on mantle-lithosphere architecture, which xenolith studies have linked
to crustal structure in the Mojave and Sierra Nevada.
Six samples ranging from fertile lherzolites
to harzburgite residues were analyzed. With $\epsilon_{\textrm{Nd}}$ of 10.3-11.0
and \ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .702, they likely represent underplated
sub-oceanic mantle.
Pyroxene and rare-earth exchange geothermometry
show equilibration at 950-1060 ÂºC.
Phase stability, Ca-in-olivine barometry, and
65-90 mW/m^2 regional geotherms
suggest entrainment at 45-75 km depth.
The samples experienced variable partial melting, and
re-enrichment of the hottest suggests deep melt interaction.
We test the Crystal Knob temperature-depth array against
a range of forward-modeled geotherms
matching plausible tectonic scenarios
for the origin of the regional mantle lithosphere.
A shallow Mendocino slab window source is excluded, and a
young Monterey-plate "stalled slab" fits xenolith thermobarometry
but is geodynamically untenable.
Suboceanic mantle lithosphere
underplated during the Cretaceous and reheated at deep levels
by the Miocene slab window matches both xenolith constraints
and the processes that shaped the overriding crust and Mojave block.
This suggests that the mantle lithosphere beneath the central California
coast was emplaced after Cretaceous flat-slab subduction and records a thermal
signature of Neogene ridge subduction.
