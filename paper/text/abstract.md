The Pleistocene (1.65 Ma) Crystal Knob volcanic neck in the California
Coast Ranges is an olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt containing dunite
and spinel peridotite xenoliths. Previous studies of xenoliths in the
Mojave and Sierra Nevada have built an understanding of links between
mantle lithosphere architecture and the upper-crustal structure of the
western cordillera. Crystal Knob erupted through the Nacimiento belt of
the Franciscan complex and adjacent to crystalline nappes of the
"Salinia terrane," and its xenoliths record the origin of the mantle
lithosphere beneath the outboard exhumed remnants of the southern
California Cretaceous subducting margin. We examine six peridotite
samples ranging from fertile lherzolites to harzburgite residues.
Time-corrected $\epsilon_{\textrm{Nd}}$ of 10.3-11.0 and
\ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .702 are characteristic of underplated
sub-oceanic mantle. Pyroxene and rare-earth exchange geothermometry show
equilibration at 950-1060 ÂºC. Phase stability, Ca-in-olivine barometry,
and 65-90 mW/m^2 regional geotherms suggest entrainment at 45-75 km
depth. The samples experienced variable partial melting, and
re-enrichment of the hottest samples suggests deep melt interaction. We
test the Crystal Knob temperature-depth array against model geotherms
matching several potential sources for the mantle lithosphere beneath
the Coast Ranges: (A) a shallow Mendocino slab window, (B) a young
Monterey-plate "stalled slab", and (C) Cretaceous underplating of
Farallon-plate lithosphere, reheated at depth by the Miocene slab
window. Models B and C fit xenolith thermobarometry, but Model B is
geodynamically untenable. We favor Model C, which fits both xenolith
constraints and the geologic history of the overriding crust and Mojave
block. The mantle lithosphere beneath the central California coast was
likely emplaced after Cretaceous flat-slab subduction and records a
thermal signature of Neogene subduction of the Pacific--Farallon ridge.
