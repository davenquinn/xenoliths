The Crystal Knob volcanic neck in the Santa Lucia Range, California, was
erupted during the Pleistocene (1.65 Ma from Ar geochronology) through the
Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan complex in the coastal region of central
California. The neck erupted an
olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt containing spinel peridotites and dunite
cumulate xenoliths. The peridotites sample the mantle lithosphere beneath the
Nacimiento Franciscan, which was constructed as an accretionary prism during
Late Cretaceous subduction of the Farallon plate. The xenolith suite is of
particular interest because it lies within the bounds of the "Salinia terrane",
a crustal fragment slivered into the Franciscan complex by strike-slip faulting.
This terrane is commonly interpreted as a rooted outlier of the SW Cordilleran
continental arc, but more recently has been shown to be a series of crystalline
nappes emplaced above the Franciscan.

Six spinel peridotite samples were analyzed, ranging from fertile lherzolites
to clinopyroxene harzburgites with modal clinopyroxene from 2-13%. They have
a depleted mantle isotopic signature and correspond to abyssal peridotites,
most likely sourced in a relict subducted slab. Ca-exchange geothermometry
shows equilibration temperatures between 950 and 1060 ÂºC. Rare-earth
geothermometry shows similar results, but hotter for the hottest samples.
Broadly the samples can be divided into two groups based on temperature of
equilibration, which also manifest in trace-element patterns, Cr content in
spinels, and Ca in olivine. Ca-in-olivine barometry and phase stability limits
suggest that the xenoliths were sourced along a depth gradient in the 45-75 km
range. This corresponds to regional geothermal
gradients ranging from 70-90 mW/m2, broadly in agreement with regional heat
flow measurements.
The samples show variable depletion, with residual harzburgites at deeper depths.
All samples show pronounced trace element re-enrichment.

Given these constraints from xenolith thermobarometry, forward modeling of
thermal evolution is used to construct a range of potential thermal structures
corresponding to likely tectonic scenarios for the evolution of the mantle
lithosphere beneath coastal California. Both a translating relict slab
associated with the Monterey Plate and Cretaceous rollback imbrication of the
Farallon plate predict reasonable geotherms corresponding to xenolith and
geophysical constraints. However, the Cretaceous relict slab aligns better with
crustal geological constraints. The preferred tectonic scenario for
construction of the coastal California mantle lithosphere is thus subduction
during the late Cretaceous, underplating during rollback extension, and cooling
at depth over the Paleogene. During the Neogene, a deep slab window at ~80 km
depth warmed the mantle lithosphere from the base.

This scenario can explain the temperature and depth distribution of the Crystal
Knob xenoliths, as well as the paired depletion and re-enrichment signatures
recorded by most of the sample set. This work shows that the mantle lithosphere
beneath the Coast Ranges was constructed in a similar fashion to the mantle
lithosphere beneath the Mojave Province. Its position near the continental
margin subjected it to major thermal pulses related to the cessation of
subduction in the Neogene.
