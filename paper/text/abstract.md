The Crystal Knob volcanic neck in the central California Coast Ranges was
erupted during the Pleistocene (1.65 Ma) through the
Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan complex in the coastal region of central
California. It is composed of
olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt containing spinel peridotites and
dunite xenoliths. The peridotites sample the mantle lithosphere beneath the
Nacimiento Franciscan, which was constructed as an accretionary prism during
Late Cretaceous subduction of the Farallon plate.
The Crystal Knob locality is of further interest because it lies in immediate
proximity to crystalline nappes of the “Salinia terrane”, which are
traditionally interpreted as a rooted crustal sliver,
but which more recent studies show are detached and
lying above the Franciscan complex.

Six spinel peridotite samples were analyzed, ranging from fertile lherzolites
to clinopyroxene harzburgites with modal clinopyroxene from 2-13%. They have
a depleted mantle Sr and Nd isotopic signature and correspond to abyssal peridotites,
most likely sourced in a relict subducted slab. Ca-exchange geothermometry
shows equilibration temperatures between 950 and 1060 ºC. Rare-earth
geothermometry shows similar results, but hotter for the hottest and deepest samples.
Broadly the samples can be divided into two groups based on temperature of
equilibration, which also manifest in trace-element patterns, Cr content in
spinels, and Ca in olivine. Ca-in-olivine barometry and phase stability limits
suggest that the xenoliths were sourced along a depth gradient in the 45-75 km
range. This corresponds to regional geothermal
gradients ranging from 70-90 mW/m2, broadly in agreement with regional heat
flow measurements.
The samples show variable depletion, with residual harzburgites at deeper depths.
All samples show pronounced trace element re-enrichment.

Given constraints from xenolith thermobarometry, forward modeling of thermal
evolution is used to construct a range of potential thermal structures that are
tested against plausible tectonic scenarios for the evolution of the mantle
lithosphere beneath the region. Underplated Late Cretaceous Farallon plate
floored by a deep slab window, and underplated Neogene Monterey microplate
equally satisfy the thermal constraints, but a shallow Neogene slab window is
excluded. Underplated Farallon plate best satisfies the crustal geological
constraints. Given this, the preferred tectonic scenario for the construction
of the region’s mantle lithosphere is subduction underplating of Farallon plate
during the latest Cretaceous followed by cooling at depth over the Paleogene,
and then superposed slab window formation at ~80 km depth during the Neogene.
This scenario can explain the temperature and depth distribution of the Crystal
Knob xenoliths, as well as the paired depletion and re-enrichment signatures
recorded by most of the samples. This work shows that the mantle lithosphere
beneath the Coast Ranges was constructed in a similar fashion as the mantle
lithosphere beneath the Mojave Province; two regions that were in immediate
proximity to one another prior to late Neogene-Quaternary dextral offsets along
the San Andreas transform system.
