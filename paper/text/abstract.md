The Pleistocene (1.65 Ma) Crystal Knob volcanic neck in the California
Coast Ranges is an olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt containing dunite and
spinel peridotite xenoliths. Previous studies of xenoliths in the Mojave and Sierra
Nevada have built an understanding of link between mantle lithosphere
architecture and the upper-crustal structure of the western cordillera. Crystal
Knob erupted through the Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan complex and
crystalline nappes of the "Salinia terrane," and its xenoliths
record the origin of the mantle lithosphere beneath the outboard exhumed
remnants of the southern California Cretaceous subducting margin. Six samples
ranging from fertile lherzolites to harzburgite residues were analyzed.
Time-corrected $\epsilon_{\textrm{Nd}}$ of 10.3-11.0 and
\ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .702, are characteristic of underplated
sub-oceanic mantle. Pyroxene and rare-earth exchange geothermometry show
equilibration at 950-1060 ÂºC. Phase stability, Ca-in-olivine barometry, and
65-90 mW/m^2 regional geotherms suggest entrainment at 45-75 km depth. The
samples experienced variable partial melting, and re-enrichment of the hottest
samples suggests deep melt interaction. We test the Crystal Knob
temperature-depth array against model geotherms matching a range of tectonic
scenarios: A shallow Mendocino slab window source is excluded, and a young
Monterey-plate "stalled slab" fits xenolith thermobarometry but is
geodynamically untenable. Cretaceous underplating of suboceanic mantle
lithosphere and reheating at depth by the Miocene slab window fits both
xenolith constraints and the geologic history of the overriding crust and
Mojave block. This suggests that the mantle lithosphere beneath the central
California coast was emplaced after Cretaceous flat-slab subduction and records
a thermal signature of Neogene subduction of the Pacific--Farallon ridge.
