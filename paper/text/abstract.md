The Pleistocene (1.65 Ma) Crystal Knob volcanic neck in the California
Coast Ranges is an olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt containing dunite
and spinel peridotite xenoliths.
The peridotites sample the mantle lithosphere beneath the
Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan complex and crystalline
nappes of the "Salinia terrane," which together form
extended and exhumed remnants of the Cretaceous subduction complex
and magmatic arc of southern California.
Crystal Knob, located near the continental margin, substantially
extends a body of xenolith evidence linking mantle-lithosphere
construction to regional crustal geology.
Six samples ranging from fertile lherzolites
to harzburgite residues were analyzed. With $\epsilon_{\textrm{Nd}}$ of 10.3-11.0
and \ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .702, they likely represent underplated
sub-oceanic mantle.
The samples show a range of depletion by partial melting
and minor refertilization with substantial melting and re-enrichement
recorded by the deepest samples.
Pyroxene major-element and rare-earth geothermometry
show equilibration temperatures of 950-1060 ÂºC.
Phase stability, Ca-in-olivine barometry, and
predicted regional geothermal gradients of 65-90 \si{mW/m2}
suggest equilibration depths of 45-75 km.
We test xenolith thermobarometry against
a range of forward-modeled geotherms
matching plausible tectonic scenarios
for the origin of the regional mantle lithosphere.
A shallow Neogene slab window source is excluded, and a
young Monterey-plate "stalled slab" fits geothermal constraints.
However, suboceanic mantle lithosphere
underplated during the Cretaceous and reheated
by a Neogene thermal pulse corresponding to the Mendocino slab window
fits both the temperature--depth array
and deep melt interaction evident in the Crystal Knob xenolith suite.
We conclude that the mantle lithosphere beneath the central California coast
was constructed by Cretaceous tectonic events and records a thermal
history of Neogene ridge subduction.
