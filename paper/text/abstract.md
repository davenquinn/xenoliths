The Pleistocene (1.65 Ma) Crystal Knob volcanic neck in the California
Coast Ranges is an olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt containing dunite
and spinel peridotite xenoliths.
The peridotites sample the mantle lithosphere beneath the
Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan complex and extensional crystalline
nappes of the "Salinia terrane," which together compose the exhumed remnants of
the southern California Farallon-plate subduction complex and magmatic
arc. Crystal Knob adds to a body of xenolith evidence tying
mantle-lithosphere construction to crustal geological constraints, but
is of considerable interest due to its position near the continental
margin.

Six spinel peridotite samples were analyzed, ranging from fertile lherzolites
to harzburgite residues. They have a depleted mantle Sr and Nd isotopic signature
corresponding to upwelling asthenosphere (e.g. a stalled oceanic slab).
Pyroxene Ca-exchange geothermometry
shows equilibration temperatures between 950 and 1060 ºC.
Rare-earth-element temperatures are broadly consistent,
but with evidence that the hottest samples
underwent a fossil heating event.
Ca-in-olivine barometry and phase stability limits
suggest a xenolith source in the 45-75 km
depth range. This corresponds to regional geothermal
gradients of 65-90 mW/m2, broadly matching regional heat
flow measurements.
The samples show a range of depletion by partial melting, which is
expressed consistently in phase and whole-rock chemistry.
Most samples show low levels of refertilization, with <1% assimilation
of alkali-basalt-like
melt, but the hottest and deepest sample (CK-6) records the substantial
addition of fractionated material to a depleted host.

Constraints from xenolith thermobarometry are tested against a
range of forward-modeled geotherms
matching plausible tectonic scenarios for the origin of the mantle
lithosphere beneath coastal California.
A shallow Neogene slab window source is excluded, but
Farallon-plate material underplated in the Late Cretaceous
and reheated by deep slab-window
upwelling and a young Monterey-plate "stalled slab"
equally conform to the Crystal Knob dataset, but the former
best aligns with crustal geological data.
This scenario explains both the temperature--depth array
and evidence of re-enrichment seen in the
Crystal Knob xenoliths.
Given this, the preferred origin of
of the region’s mantle lithosphere is as
Farallon material that was underplated
during the latest Cretaceous, in a manner similar to  the
adjacent Mojave Province.
However, this mantle lithosphere domain experienced a deep thermal pulse
during the Neogene, aligned with the Mendocino slab window.
