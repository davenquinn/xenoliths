The Crystal Knob volcanic neck in the Santa Lucia Range, California, was
erupted during the Pleistocene (1.65 Ma from Ar geochronology) through the
Nacimiento belt of the Franciscan complex in the coastal region of central
California. The neck erupted an
olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt containing spinel peridotites and dunite
cumulate xenoliths. The peridotites sample the mantle lithosphere beneath the
Nacimiento Franciscan, which was constructed as an accretionary prism during
Late Cretaceous subduction of the Farallon plate. The xenolith suite is of
particular interest because it lies within the bounds of the "Salinia terrane",
a crustal fragment slivered into the Franciscan complex by strike-slip faulting.
This terrane is commonly interpreted as a rooted outlier of the SW Cordilleran
continental arc, but more recently has been shown to be a series of crystalline
nappes emplaced above the Franciscan.

Six spinel peridotite samples were analyzed, ranging from fertile lherzolites
to clinopyroxene harzburgites with modal clinopyroxene from 2-13%. They have a depleted
mantle isotopic signature and correspond to abyssal peridotites, most likely
sourced in a relict subducted slab. Ca-exchange geothermometry shows
equilibration temperatures between 950 and 1060 ÂºC. Rare-earth geothermometry
shows similar results, but hotter for the hottest samples. Broadly the samples
can be divided into two groups based on temperature of equilibration, which
also manifest in trace-element patterns, Cr content in spinels, and Ca in
olivine. This variability means the samples were likely entrained at several
depths. Considering broad limits imposed by phase stability and temperature,
the samples are likely sourced between 40 and 80 km depth. The
higher-temperature samples show general REE depletion but sharp enrichment in
LREEs, potentially showing a history of melt extraction followed by off-axis
refertilization.

Forward modeling of thermal evolution is used to construct a range of scenarios
for the age of the underplated Farallon slab and structure of the margin.
Scenarios ranging from a young "stalled slab" to the rollback imbrication of
Farallon lithosphere in the Cretaceous to Paleocene imply relatively cool
modern geotherms approaching steady-state heat flow. These scenarios generally
predict colder conditions at depth than are recorded by the xenoliths or
surface heat-flow data implying that the xenoliths are sourced from the bottom
of their stability field, and that fluid migration following the plate boundary
may be an important process for increasing local heat transfer rates.
