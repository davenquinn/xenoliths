The Pleistocene (1.65 Ma) Crystal Knob volcanic neck in the California Coast
Ranges is an olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt containing dunite and spinel
peridotite xenoliths. Crystal Knob erupted through the Nacimiento belt of the
Franciscan complex and adjacent to Salinian crystalline nappes.
Its xenoliths sample the mantle lithosphere beneath the outboard exhumed
remnants of the southern California Cretaceous subducting margin. This sample
set augments previously-studied xenolith suites in the Mojave and Sierra Nevada, which
linked the mantle lithosphere architecture and crustal structure of the
western Cordillera. We examine six peridotite samples ranging from fertile
lherzolites to harzburgite residues. Time-corrected $\epsilon_{\textrm{Nd}}$ of
10.3-11.0 and \ce{^{87}Sr}/\ce{^{86}Sr} of .702 are characteristic of
underplated sub-oceanic mantle. Pyroxene-exchange geothermometry
shows equilibration at 950-1060ÂºC. Phase stability, Ca-in-olivine barometry,
and 65-90 mW/m^2 regional geotherms suggest entrainment at 45-75 km depth. The
samples were variably depleted by partial melting, and re-enrichment of the hottest
samples suggests deep melt interaction. We test the Crystal Knob
temperature-depth array against model geotherms matching potential sources for
the mantle lithosphere beneath the Coast Ranges: (A) a shallow Mendocino slab
window, (B) a young Monterey-plate "stalled slab", and (C) Farallon-plate
mantle nappes, underplated during the Cretaceous and reheated at depth by the
Miocene slab window. Models B and C fit xenolith thermobarometry, but only
Model C fits the tectonic and geodynamic evolution of southern California. We
conclude that the mantle lithosphere beneath the central California coast was
emplaced after Cretaceous flat-slab subduction and records a thermal signature
of Neogene subduction of the Pacific--Farallon ridge.
