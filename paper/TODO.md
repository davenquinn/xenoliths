# Tasks

[+] Make Sm/Nd chart that includes data for Cima/Dish
    Hill as well as other xenolith localities
[ ] Move "BAD TAGS" into this repository
[ ] Add a few new tags to "BAD TAGS" for core
    calculation.
[+] Recalculated trace elements (using Witt-Eickschen and O'Neill methodology)
[ ] Finish classifications
[+] Figure of classification data (mineral textures?)
[ ] Recalculate CK-4 with only HREEs
[ ] T_CHUR and T_PM for Sm/Nd?
[ ] Make a figure of all xenolith thin sections
[ ] Sample depletion degrees (using Mg, Cr, Al and REE)

Better map
Depletion
Label and cross-reference all figures
A few stray tables (mineral modes, etc.)

# Questions

[+] Make T_BKN not use reported calibration errors
    (for conformance with other thermometers)?
[ ] Mineral compositions reported in rescaled oxides
    or modal (probably should change to oxide).
[ ] Maybe some sort of sensitivity analysis
    for the model?
[ ] Is there any kinetic control on dissolution
    of Cr-spinel to garnet? i.e. could samples
    be in some sort of shared stability field?
[ ] Schematic: amount of rollback required to put
    plate at 50 km depth
