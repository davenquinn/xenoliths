e Monterey plate nucleated along a ~250 km 861 segment of the Paci c-Farallon ridge as an oblique rift that was rotated ~25o clockwise from the 862 Paci c-Farallon rift axis (Atwater and Severinghaus, 1989). Its generation was synchronous with 863 the early stages of Paci c-Farallon plate convergence into the Cordilleran subduction zone along 864 the southern California coastal region, and coincided with transrotational rifting of the continen- 865 tal borderland region and displacement of the western Transverse Ranges bedrock (Bohannon and 866 Parsons, 1995; Atwater and Stock, 1998).

It would be nice to remind readers what TA98 refers to. Maybe just say "see section 2.7 of text"
