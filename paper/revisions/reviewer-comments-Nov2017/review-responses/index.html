Salinia’s Late Cretaceous history - involving detaching from the southern Sierra Nevada and being shed some ~50 km to the SSW - likely has a lot to do with it (Wood and Saleeby, 1997 and me et al., 2012). During this extensional episode, the Salinian basement was pervasively fractured, which likely made it permeable to fluids/heat. The southern Sierra Nevada, on the other hand, escaped pervasive fracturing given that it was in the footwall of the Late Cretaceous detachment system. As a result it is characterized by low heat flow. <span class="fixed">Thanks, made sure to mention this history</span>

Line 922: &quot;dangling slab&quot; - I didn’t see this term in Pikser et al., who use “remnant” or “stalled slab,” which are not as gross.

943-959: I feel that this whole part can be deleted because it distracts from the main message of the paper. 933-942 are enough to reject the &quot;dangling slab&quot; as a mechanism for bringing mantle lithosphere to the xenolith source region. <span class="partial">Yeah, but it needs to be directly attacked in the literature at some point, and this paper is the best opportunity.

Line 1002: i don’t see the connection between the first and second half of this sentence. Are you implying that the schist was emplaced when T along the megathrust was ~715˚C, hence the calculated peak temps from the schist of SdS? I’m not sure upper and lower plates would thermally equilibrate so efficiently. I don’t think this is super critical for your argument, so perhaps consider removing this. <span class="partial">We use this in the modeling setup so we keep it here, reworking for clarity.</span>

<p class="comment r3">
A big question here that isn't really addressed is why these duplexes would form. Duplexes are typical of compressional situations, not extensional environments such as those occurring in the crust at this time. Here's a possibility: For several million years (~5 m.y. according to figure 19) following flat subduction of the overthickened lithosphere, duplexing resulted from slowing of the subducting plateau's trajectory to the east and resistance to restarting steeper subduction (to initiating a new path for the slab downward) all the while maintaining the convergence rate dictated by PAC-NAM plate motion. These boundary conditions a created situation where the slab underwent shortening-this compressional event in the mantle lithosphere would likely cause uplift and further destabilization of the overlying crust. Could this even be the MAIN cause of late Cretaceous upper crustal extension in the Salinia- Mojave region. <span class="fixed"> Duplexes are common in extensional environments, use Gabrielsen and Clausen (2001 GSA Mem 193) to break into literature, although our application is different from the cited paper here. We think that your scenario laid out here is basically what we had in mind (or at least one of the viable options) but attempt to explain in terms of mantle-lithosphere structure. We have sharpened our description based on your feedback, and hope that this is less confusing. </span>

1288: I don’t follow. Figure 18c shows the source of xl knob xenoliths on the eastern wall of the SGHf. How does putting Monterey lithosphere against slab window heated farallon lithosphere generate melt? If anything, it should cool down the farallon lithosphere. Furthermore, the SGHf initiated in late Miocene (e.g., Dickinson et al., 2005), so why should the lag between slab window and xl knob eruption be so huge (~20 myr) ? Perhaps this is a nutty idea, but Ducea et al. ’03 shows evidence for a profound increase in denudation rate in the neighborhood of Xl knob at ca. 2 Ma. Could these be related?
