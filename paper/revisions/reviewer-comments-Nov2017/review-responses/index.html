<p class="comment r3">
The manuscript by Quinn et al., explores the geochemistry of a suite of xenoliths erupted through the Franciscan belt in central California and investigates a series of 1D thermal models in order to evaluate possible tectonic scenarios for the upper mantle that were previously proposed for the region. These xenoliths have not previously been investigated and the analysis carried out here will be of significant interest to workers interested in western U.S. tectonics. The mantle duplex idea explored here will be of interest to a wider community. The methods and conclusions seem reasonable to this (non-geochemist) reader. The language is clear (some minor issues pointed out below), but the document seems longer than necessary. I do not have any specific recommendations on how to shorten it, but I encourage the authors to condense it for the sake of future readers. One general comment is that interpretations have been mixed in with methods and descriptions throughout the text in a way that sort of works but is also a little unconventional-I'm not sure I agree that it was necessary to dispense with the traditional sequence/existence of sections dedicated to methods-&gt; observations-&gt; interpretations. <span>The existing format helped in reducing the overall text length by not having to review various items multiple times in order to pose our various data acquisition pursuits as well as our interpretations.</span>

A big question here that isn't really addressed is why these duplexes would form. Duplexes are typical of compressional situations, not extensional environments such as those occurring in the crust at this time. Here's a possibility: For several million years (~5 m.y. according to figure 19) following flat subduction of the overthickened lithosphere, duplexing resulted from slowing of the subducting plateau's trajectory to the east and resistance to restarting steeper subduction (to initiating a new path for the slab downward) all the while maintaining the convergence rate dictated by PAC-NAM plate motion. These boundary conditions a created situation where the slab underwent shortening-this compressional event in the mantle lithosphere would likely cause uplift and further destabilization of the overlying crust. Could this even be the MAIN cause of late Cretaceous upper crustal extension in the Salinia- Mojave region.
