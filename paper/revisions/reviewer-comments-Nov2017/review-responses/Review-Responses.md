# Overall evaluations

<p class='comment r3'>The manuscript by Quinn et al., explores the geochemistry of a suite of xenoliths erupted through the Franciscan belt in central California and investigates a series of 1D thermal models in order to evaluate possible tectonic scenarios for the upper mantle that were previously proposed for the region. These xenoliths have not previously been investigated and the analysis carried out here will be of significant interest to workers interested in western U.S. tectonics. The mantle duplex idea explored here will be of interest to a wider community. The methods and conclusions seem reasonable to this (non-geochemist) reader. The language is clear (some minor issues pointed out below), but the document seems longer than necessary. I do not have any specific recommendations on how to shorten it, but I encourage the authors to condense it for the sake of future readers. One general comment is that interpretations have been mixed in with methods and descriptions throughout the text in a way that sort of works but is also a little unconventional-I'm not sure I agree that it was necessary to dispense with the traditional sequence/existence of sections dedicated to methods-> observations-> interpretations.
<span>The existing format helped in reducing the overall text length by not having to review various items multiple times in order to pose our various data acquisition pursuits as well as our interpretations.</span>

# Abstract {-}

<p class='comment r1'>
unclear - perhaps “…a new constraint on the mantle lithosphere
architecture of the continental margin, which…”
<span class="response r1 fixed ">Updated wording substantially and reordered to clarify importance of mantle xenoliths constraints constraint.</span><p>
<p class="response r1 fixed">*existing* xenolith studies</p>
<p class="response r1 fixed">Added new clarifications of time-corrected isotope values.</p>

<p class='comment r1'> In lines 5-6, xenolith studies are said to link crustal
structure, but I found this confusing because they are supposed to be mantle
xenoliths. Clarify. <span class="partial">Reversed order of a few sentences to reword</span>
</p>

<p class="comment r2"> In line 8-9, the xenoliths are reported to be
underplated sub-oceanic mantle, but I was left wondering here (as well as
later) what happened to the intervening oceanic crust.
<span class=partial> This is not easily knowable, as the oceanic crust is not sampled by xenoliths. This is addressed sparingly in cross-sectional views and discussion of seismic data, but cannot be easily summarized in abstract </span> </p>

<p class="comment r2"> In the final line, "Neogene ridge subduction" is
invoked, and I wondered if the Neogene ridge has a name, or if the oceanic
segments on either side are named (Farallon-Pacific? Juan de Fuca-Pacific?).
<span class=partial> Added Pacific-Farallon ridge provisionally, but it gets confusing
because this event led to formation of microplates and eventually the Juan de
Fuca plate. This will be removed if there are length concerns. </span> </p>

<p class="response r1"> Significant rewording to better introduce tectonic
scenarios </p>

# Key points {-}

<p class="comment r2"> I would just say "The 1.65 Ma Crystal Knob volcanic pipe
hosts xenoliths from the deep mantle lithosphere"
<span class="response rejected"> The California coast is a key distinguisher, and saying
“subducting margin” although more specific requires a statement of when we
envision this subduction. Abstract includes this, but we think it is too
nuanced for key points. </span>

# Intro

<p class="comment r2"> Lines 3, 14: the "crustal column" is confusing - is this

<span class='response  partial'>Changed in one instance for clarity, but kept
“lithospheric column” in the following paragraph, as the fact that xenoliths
sample lithospheric columns is a generic statement</span>

<p class="comment r2"> Line 17: citing only Ducea et al 2015 suggests this work

<p class="comment r2  rejected"> Line 22: I don't think the quotes around
Salinian terrane or Salinia are necessary <span class='response'> We strongly
disagree. Salinia has traditionally been used for a mantle lithosphere rooted
semi-intact displaced terrane, and many researchers not current with the most
pertinent literature still envision it as such. The expected compositions and
P-T history an intact batholithic terrane (the traditional view of Salinia)
would root into a fundamentally different mantle lithosphere than a long-lived
subduction accretion assemblage (the Franciscan, including its recently
recognized roof nappes of Salinia arc rocks). Important distinction for study
of ML xenoliths! </span> </p>

  In the first instance, we tweaked slightly for clarity, but hold that the detection of composite grains is a basic petrographic technique that should not need much introduction.

### Modal mineralogy

<p class="comment r3"> various places, e.g. 265: distinguishing them as

dunite. Is there a better word choice to replace "peridotite?"
<span class="response"> We understand the concern and have tweaked to "spinel peridotites" in some places.  “Dunites” would be properly set against “polyphase peridotites” or “lherzolites and harzburgites”.

1011. "accelerated rollback is driven by the formation of Farallon-plate mantle

      "rollback" in the sense most think of... such duplexing would be more of
      a shallow mantle "pile-up" phenomena, perhaps involving a break in what

</p>

<p class="comment r3"> A big question here that isn't really addressed is why
these duplexes would form. Duplexes are typical of compressional situations,
not extensional environments such as those occurring in the crust at this time.
Here's a possibility: For several million years (\~5 m.y. according to figure
19) following flat subduction of the overthickened lithosphere, duplexing
resulted from slowing of the subducting plateau's trajectory to the east and
resistance to restarting steeper subduction (to initiating a new path for the
slab downward) all the while maintaining the convergence rate dictated by
PAC-NAM plate motion. These boundary conditions a created situation where the
slab underwent shortening-this compressional event in the mantle lithosphere
would likely cause uplift and further destabilization of the overlying crust.
Could this even be the MAIN cause of late Cretaceous upper crustal extension in
the Salinia- Mojave region. </p>

1205: how far is far? Can you give a km range? </p>


<p class="comment r2"> 1218-1219: I would rephrase this to explain why you

explained. Is it an automated procedure? A methods section would be a good
place for this. </p>

<p class="comment r2"> Some general issues to look out for: Figures seem to
numbered out of sequence Tables (esp Table 1) could be referenced more
References are sometimes not ordered by date </p>
