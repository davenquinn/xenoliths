Over longer timescales, the inward stepping of the transverse plate
boundary to the San Andreas fault zone has generated significant
shortening and uplift in the Coast Ranges since the Miocene
[@Dickinson2005].

Evaluation of potential thermal scenarios sampled by Crystal Knob
requires constraints on the implied present geotherm.
Forward-modeling of the initial thermal conditions will help assess the
level of separation between the scenarios after 25 Myr or more of
re-equilibration beneath the continental margin.

However, this analysis is a crude approximation due to a lack of well-constrained geobarometers for spinel
peridotites.
