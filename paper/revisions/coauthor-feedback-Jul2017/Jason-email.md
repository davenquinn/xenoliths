Hi Daven,
 
Attached are both Mihai’s and Peter’s edited WORD files of the manuscript. I felt that it was in good shape when you sent it out, and now seeing that Mihai did not tear it up seems to say that it really is ready to submit with some confidence. Where I have left their respective edits alone I leave it up to you to decide as to whether or not you want to incorporate into the final version to be submitted. Otherwise I comment in blue (just noticed it may be re-formatted into bold red italics) bold italic.
 
I worked through Mihai’s edits first. He mentions a paper by Brandon et al. (incorrect first author) on Dish Hill that we should cite. It is a crappy paper, but Peter also suggests that we cite it. He correctly gives the author as Armytage et al. (2015), as well as the entire reference. We would all be fine with not citing the paper, but we run the risk of offending potential reviewers, and ending up with a negative review. Working with Peter’s WORD file, not Mihai’s (!), I suggest two places in the text, with minor wording modifications, where we could cite Armytage et al. Once we are through review, I would be fine, actually preferable, to remove the citation. Let’s see where we are down the line, after reviews.
 
Also, below I copy from Peter’s cover letter email, and comment for you.
 
I think that you have done a great job in both the research and the manuscript prep. Make the edits, as you see fit from our collective comments, and submit. Give me an update on publication charges. If you want I can try to make a special plea to John for some Division help. I do have some money, but not that much. It would be nice to get this resolved soon, because if the Division will not help, I may just not go to the upcoming GSA meeting in order to have more money left in my account for pub fees. The upcoming GSA abstract deadline is August 1. Also, I would appreciate you pushing on John-Philippe re TO funds. He had a lot of slush funds left at the end of the TO, and I specifically asked him to set some aside for TO funded research papers that find their way into the literature after the end of the TO. Who knows…….

FROM PETER’S COMMENTS:
 
1. Some reviewers might not like that methods, observations, different modelings, and interpretations are mingled at different levels. This, however, clearly is a complex study, which cannot be easily squeezed into a standard paper structure; thus it would be great if the table of content could make it into the front of the paper to guide the reader (I'm not sure though whether G3 accommodates tables of content).

!Don’t bother!

2. A great deal of attention is paid to the PT conditions of the xenoliths, but at the end I felt like the thermal modeling doesn't really require that level of details. The only reason I comment on this is that, after reading the thermobarometry section, I was prepared to see exploited and integrated all those carefully evaluated details, but found that not all are (For example, from the perspective of the paper's main purposes, does it matter that there are two distinct sample cohorts?) To clear things up, a reverse engineering-like thought exercise like this may help: if the thermal modeling section would precede the thermobarometry section, it would be clear what level of accuracy and precision is required in PTmetry in order to make a difference among the tested scenarios. Which are those PTmetry details that make no difference in this respect? Can I remove them altogether or put them in the supplementary material?

This seems risky. At the appropriate spot in Peter’s edited WORD file I suggest that you maybe ask Paul’s opinion on this, but I leave it to you. We could leave as is, and I would be fine with it. On the other hand, we never pursued the possibility that the two temperature cohorts are telling us that the peridotite xenoliths are sampling a composite section akin to what we found at Dish Hill. I will email Peter about this to get his opinion, and copy to you.
