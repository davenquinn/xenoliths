I would list these as scenarios A, B, and C to be consistent with the text. Then also say "Models B and C fit the xenolith thermobarometry, but model B is geodynamically untenable. We favor model C, Cretaceous underplating of .... "

I don't think this is the right word. Determine seems better. ("discern" = distinguish)

I still thinks this needs more clarification, especially for the dunites: how do cumulates, presumbaly from the magma chamber (in the crust) "establish context" for xenoliths from the mantle, a totally different and possibly unrelated source?

is this saying that the fault transports fluid from shallow to deep, or vice versa?

I find the heat flow discussion to still be confusing, and indirect. Presumably heat flow is higher in the deep lithosphere (i.e., mantle fluids are hot). Are you saying that 90% of surface heat flow component is from the deep lithosphere? Just say that. Otherwise this sounds like the deep lithosphere is 60-80 mW/m2 and somehow the surface has an additional 10.

Estimates of the thermal state of the deep lithosphere derived from seismic tomography show temperatures of 700–1100◦C occurring at depths of 50–100km for coastal California [Goes and van der Lee, 2002], corresponding to cooler geotherms than predicted by sur- face heat flow alone. More recent estimates put the depth of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at roughly 70 km in the southern Coast Ranges [Li et al., 2007]. Given estimates that the subcontinental lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary occurs at 1200-1300◦C [e.g. O’Reilly and Griffin, 2010; Fischer et al., 2010], this corresponds to steady-state geotherms of 70-80 mW/m2

This seems like it fits better in sect. 3.1

in theory,

this sentence make no sense. tomographic images can suggest this, but what is the seismic data you are talking about?



Seismic data cited in support of a structurally continuous stalled slab consist of an 8-15 km thick, shallowly east-dipping mafic lower crustal layer
