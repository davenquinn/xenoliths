<p>QUINN ET AL. REVIEW - A. CHAPMAN</p>
<p>February 5, 2018</p>
<p>This revised manuscript by Quinn and coauthors contributes a large amount of new data, from a mantle xenolith locality in central coastal California. The integration of new petrologic data, new modeling, and existing seismic data in this effort is very thorough and the story, polished since the last time I had a look, is very well articulated. This effort appears nearly ready to be published in g-cubed. The paper is well-written and generally free of typos, so I haven't uploaded a file containing specific in-text comments. I do still think that the paper would be significantly improved by cutting some of the modeling setup/analytical considerations/figures and tossing them in with supplementary material. As is, the paper is quite long and dense and it can be difficult to see the forest through the trees in sections.</p>
<p>Also, the intro section is well written, but lacks clear and succinct statements that clue the reader in to what is being done and why. In my mind, the &quot;what&quot; is: new petrographic, thermobarometric, geochemical, Sr and Nd isotopic, and Ar-Ar geochronologic data, from peridotite xenoliths recovered from the Crystal Knob locality. The &quot;why&quot;: These new datasets, plus derivative geochemical modeling and thermal modeling of the central California lithosphere, are aimed at deciphering 1) the petrogenesis of Crystal Knob xenoliths and host basaltic lavas and 2) evaluating three models for the Late Cretaceous to Quaternary evolution of the lithosphere beneath central California. Some discussion of the three models would be really helpful in the intro.</p>
<p>Again, I sincerely enjoyed reading this paper and I think that, with a minor amount of revision, it will serve as a quality contribution to our understanding of how continental margins are perturbed by changes in slab dip and subduction of spreading ridges. Following revision, this paper will be an excellent contribution to g-cubed.</p>
<h2 id="reviewer-2-comments">Reviewer 2 comments</h2>
<p>This is a review with minor revisions but there are a few SMALL issues that the authors should address. There does not need to be a re-review. I have highlighted grammatical errors that need to be fixed, and added notes for questions or comments that the authors need to address. Other grammatical fixes are made with Adobe Acrobat editing tools in the attached file. --Elisabeth Nadin</p>

<p>Reviewer #3 (Formal Review for Authors (shown to authors)):</p>
<p>This is my second review of the manuscript by Quinn et al., which explores the geochemistry of a suite of xenoliths erupted through the Franciscan belt in central California and investigates a series of 1D thermal models in order to evaluate possible tectonic scenarios for the upper mantle that were previously proposed for the region. I did not have any major issues the first time around, but am also not well-versed in the geochemistry and peridotite petrology work comprising the backbone of the paper. Looking at the reply to reviewers it seems that most things have been cleared up by Quinn et al. or they have made a reasonable rebuttal. I have corrected a lot of typographical errors and made additional minor comments on the first 2/3 of the paper. Such things will need to be handled by a proof reader in the latter portion of the paper.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p class="comment">
Line 6 of abstract. Crystal knob volcanics did not erupt through Salinian terrane. Figure 1 shows the location of the xenoliths site as (barely) west of the Nascimiento fault. Salinian rocks are to the east in the hanging wall, so they are not to be found in the volcanic column.
</p>
<p>Line 5. assemblyntle</p>
<p class="comment">
Line 13. Delete &quot;crucially&quot; (overly dramatic, crucially important for who? A few dozen people interested in the precise origins of the mantle lithosphere beneath a sparsely populated part of of Southern California?)
</p>
<p class="comment">
Line 20. Reference issue &quot;Chapman, 2016; Chapman et al., 2016a&quot;, these should be a and b??line 43.
</p>
<p class="comment">
Loose language here: Seismic reflections shows what is <em>interpreted to be</em> a former megathrust.
</p>
<p>Line 44. &quot;That&quot; instead of &quot;and?&quot;</p>
<p>Line 115. &quot;Alternatively suggests&quot;? Instead of &quot;suggests&quot;?</p>
<p>Line 139. These would be &quot;thick&quot; sections if that thickness is accurate. But I think from figure three that the sections must be a lot closer to standard thickness of 30 microns.</p>
<p>Figure 1 caption. Why does it say &quot;see also 17&quot;? Also should say &quot;the modern&quot; (missing &quot;the&quot;)</p>
<p>There are some labeling problems in Figure 1. It shows a lot of light grey &quot;late cenozoic volcanic rocks&quot; in Salinia and elsewhere where volcanic rocks aren't actually found. I think light grey should be labeled metamorphic framework?? Also there is a light purple color (very similar to the light grey) in the Southern Sierra Nevada and elsewhere that isn't defined in the key.</p>
<p>Figure 5 caption. The bottom right quadrant of ck4 looks just like portions of the other samples. Are we supposed to be able to identify the &quot;melt channel&quot;? If not, why is it mentioned? If so, It isn't evident to this reader.</p>
<p>Figure 4 not mentioned in text before figure 5</p>

<li>&quot;and emphasizing&quot; 179. &quot;dunites fragments&quot;</li>
</ol></li>
<li>what are &quot;parallel domain boundaries&quot; and their significance? Provide a reference or figure. Googling this, it doesn't seem to be a common thing... Do you mean large, parallel, subgrain-boundaries cutting across grains?</li>
</ol>
<p>259-260., 327-328 and elsewhere. I'm quite dubious regarding the significance of the calculated whole rock values given the very small areas upon which the modal work is estimated (figure 5).</p>
<ol start="309" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>would be useful to cite the more recent Chapman et al (2014) on Salinian granites here also.</li>
</ol>
<p>figure 13 caption &quot;the tightness of within-sample temperature scatter varies.&quot; is there a simpler way to say this (not sure exactly what is being said)</p>
<p>443-446. I'm not sure. Can you give a citation for this claim? It kind of sounds like you're just taking the mean two different ways and getting the same number both times--how does that indicate equilibrium?</p>
<ol start="477" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>&quot;Figure 12&quot; in parentheses.</li>
</ol>
<p>537-543. Lots of issues with this paragraph. My recollection is that the Salinian granitoids are not significantly different radiogenically from the Sierra Nevadan rocks (as seemingly implied here in the context of the previous paragraph). Also, the high uplift rates mentioned from Ducea et al., 2003 is probably from an area of atypically high exhumation rates-the preservation of the Crystal Knob volcanic rocks indicates that erosion rates are much lower in this particular spot than where Ducea et al. observed. The final sentence suggests that the minuscule amount of lava associated with Crystal Knob would affect the geotherm in a measurable way-this is probably demonstrably false.</p>
<p>549-558. I don't understand the logic about surface heat flows representing a maximum limit on mantle lithosphere geothermal gradients. Has this concept been explored before? If so, a reference would be good here... I think there is a lot of speculative material that should just be cut. Just say that surface heat flows in the Coast Ranges are 70-90 mW/m2 and leave it at that. Speculatively trimming 10 mW/m2 off makes no difference considering the large uncertainties (e.g. figure 16). This whole section (3.2) can be trimmed down significantly-the essential message is given in lines 658-660.</p>
<p>Figure 16 caption. &quot;fields&quot; not &quot;field&quot;</p>
<ol start="642" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>kmntle  650, 669, 679, maybe elsewhere: heat flow values (units of mW/m2) are not geotherms and should not be referred to as such.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;crust Section 3.1&quot;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>728-729. This statement seems to be contradicted by the sentence at 741-742.</p>
