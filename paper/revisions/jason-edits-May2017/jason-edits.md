We neglect the effects of shear heating by simple down-dip
displacements along the subduction megathrust based on the thermal
modeling of @Kidder2013.

, and the Monterey Plate scenario matches
well with the geothermal
constraints derived from heat flow modeling.
This corresponds to the model findings of
@Erkan2008. However, these studies concluded that the low heat flows
must be due to a stalled slab, where in fact underplated Farallon mantle
nappes satisfy the surface heat flow data equally well, given a deep
slab window heating event.

In scenario **C**, relict Farallon-plate material shows low geotherms that
correspond to mantle lithosphere temperature conditions too cold for the
Crystal Knob xenolith constraints. However, when reheated by a
deep slab window in the early Miocene, this scenario
shows results similar to that for
the youngest stalled slab scenarios in **B** except for the "Monterey Plate"
scenario.

When potential
temperature overestimates from extrapolation of heat flow values
[@sec:heat-flow] are considered along with biases in model geotherms,
the slightly colder temperatures predicted by the reheated relict mantle
lithosphere scenario also fall in a reasonable range for the geotherm within
the mantle lithosphere beneath central California. This scenario thus
provides an equally attractive geothermal gradient to explain the
moderately elevated temperatures seen in the mantle lithosphere,
while fitting the geologic context much better than the
"stalled slab" scenario.
