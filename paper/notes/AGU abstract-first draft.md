The mantle beneath the southwestern North American continental margin has been shaped by several generations of tectonism.
Ultramafic xenoliths brought to the surface by Neogene volcanism record structural variations in the mantle lithosphere and provide information on its genesis and evolution.
The rarity and irregular spatial distribution of xenolith-hosting lavas make new sampling locations extremely valuable.

We present the first petrogenetic analysis of a suite of peridotite xenoliths from the Crystal Knob volcanic neck in the Santa Lucia Range, California.
The recovered xenoliths are spinel lherzolites that sample the mantle lithosphere underlying the Salinian Block.
This suite is more marginal than previously-studied xenolith locales in southern and central California; it provides an opportunity to extend westward the evolving understanding of the lithospheric mantle near the continental margin.

Clinopyroxene Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd radiogenic isotope data show these samples to have been derived from REE-depleted mantle.
Uniform enrichment in Nd (ÎµNd from 10.3 to 11.0) and depletion in 87Sr (87/86Sr of .702) rules out a continental lithosphere or Mesozoic mantle wedge source and suggests an asthenospheric or underplated oceanic mantle origin.


Restoration of the Salinian block ~300 km southeast along the San Andreas system places it directly outboard of the Mojave province prior to Neogene transform motion.
In this local context, these xenoliths provide a distal addition to the lithospheric mantle transect anchored by the Dish Hill and Cima Dome xenolith suites in the Mojave.
Luffi et al.
(2009) established these to represent a lithospheric stratigraphy containing mantle of both continental and oceanic origin.
Duplexed slices of oceanic lithosphere point to tectonic erosion and underplating of the downgoing Farallon plate during late-Cretaceous flat-slab subduction.
The fertile phase chemistry and Nd-enriched/87Sr depleted makeup of the Crystal Knob xenolith suite is consistent with that of Farallon mantle lithosphere.
  

Though suggestive of oceanic mantle lithosphere, the isotope ratios of the Crystal Knob samples could also result from the primary emplacement of asthenospheric mantle in situ beneath the continental crust of the Salinian block.
This process could mirror that observed in the Central Valley/Sierra Nevada province, where gravitational instability and slab-window heating have precipitated a Miocene to present delamination of dense arc residues and replacement with asthenospheric mantle (Saleeby et al, 2013).
In the Salinian block, replacement of the existing mantle lithosphere could be triggered by increased heat flux due to slab window formation.

Sr and Nd isotope analysis will be augmented with trace element data to determine levels of rare-earth enrichment in clinopyroxene.
Major-element phase chemistry will support cation-exchange geothermometry to isolate the formation and equilibration temperature of the samples.
If necessary, thermal and thermo-mechanical modeling will be undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of recent asthenospheric replacement given known ranges for slab window heat flux and lithospheric stability.

Analysis of the Crystal Knob xenolith suite has determined that the mantle underlying the Salinian block is not continental in origin.
The lithospheric mantle in this area is composed of either (1) underplated Farallon remnants directly related to those beneath the western Mojave, or (2) products of a large-scale asthenospheric upwelling during Neogene slab-window formation.
This accounting of the makeup of the sub-Salinian mantle lithosphere will add to the growing body of data on the mantle underpinnings of the western North American margin.
