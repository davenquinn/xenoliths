1. Mantle lithosphere is important for understanding processes, especially on western margin

2. Xenoliths help constrain mantle lithosphere makeup

3. We have them (first time for this region)

4. Regional makeup - Salinian block - used to be offshore of Mojave

5. Several hypotheses about how this mantle got here
	- Farallon plate (seen further inland)
	- Monterey plate 
	- upwelling asthenosphere from slab window
	- Continental mantle wedge (unlikely)

	These imply different thermal scenarios as well as rock compositions (mantle wedge)
	Xenoliths give us the best chance yet of answering this question

Methods
=======

- Mineral modes
- Major elements
- Trace elements
- Isotopes

Results
=======

## Petrography and mineral modes

## Thermometry

## Trace elements

## Isotopes on clinopyroxene separates

Discussion
==========

## Three emplacement options

1. Slab window @Saleeby2003

	- Possible depending on depth of Monterey slab breakoff

2. Monterey plate

	- Possible (Monterey plate is definitely there)
	- Far back from subduction interface

3. Farallon plate

	- This would conform with findings of Luffi et al

These options imply differences in thermal history
