Samples are cool relative to geotherms interpreted in Goes et al.

This conjunction of potential processes holds an opportunity to extend the evolving understanding of the subcontinental lithosphere of southern California westward to the continental margin. 


1. Monterey plate

	- Possible (Monterey plate is definitely there)
	- Far back from subduction interface

2. Farallon plate

	- This would conform with findings of Luffi et al

3. Slab window

	- Possible depending on depth of Monterey slab breakoff
	- Included more for completeness

There are some potential differences in degree of partial melting between peridotites initially emplaced  cases

## Viability of depth constraints

In the Mojave, the identification of underplated oceanic lithosphere as derived from the Farallon plate was based on geochemical repetition signifying overthrust mantle lithosphere nappes.

## Control on past geotherms

The fertile phase chemistry and Nd-enriched/87Sr depleted makeup of the Crystal Knob xenolith suite is consistent with that of Farallon mantle lithosphere.   

Without better depth constraints, distingushing between these scenarios is hard.





These options imply differences in thermal history

- Thermal modeling

The high-velocity Isabella anomaly has been correlated with epierogenic geomorphic signatures of surface downflexure in the Central Valley []







The current depth constraints are not sufficient to tell between the models


The location of the Crystal Knob neck near the Nacimiento fault places it at the boundary of several geologic provinces. 


 In particular 

 The partially subducted slab is visible in offshore seismic tomography [@Trehu1991] but the depth at which it broke is debated [@Wijk2001]. 
The study area is ~\tild\SI{80}{\kilo\meter} west of the subduction interface.

5. Several hypotheses about how this mantle got here

- Farallon plate (seen further inland)
- Monterey plate 
- upwelling asthenosphere from slab window
- Continental mantle wedge (unlikely)

These imply different thermal scenarios as well as rock compositions (mantle wedge)
Xenoliths give us the best chance yet of answering this question
