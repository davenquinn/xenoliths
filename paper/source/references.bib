@article{Baker1999,
 abstract = {We calculated primary bulk compositions for a global suite of abyssal peridotites using primary mineral modes and either analyzed or calculated phase compositions. The latter were obtained through correlations between reported mineral compositions and modal olivine contents. Both the modal data and the mineral compositions were averaged by dredge site, drill hole, or fracture zone (FZ) depending on the amount of available data. Our calculated abyssal peridotite compositions yield major-element oxide-MgO trends that are generally in good agreement with those based on compilations of ultramafic nodules and peridotite massifs. In particular, we find no statistically significant correlation between FeO(*) (total Fe as FeO) and MgO and, therefore, no evidence for significant olivine accumulation. Previous reports of a positive correlation reflect an artifact of the regressions used to calculate missing phase compositions and result in a relationship between the Mg??? of olivine and modal olivine abundance that is inconsistent with observed variations in abyssal peridotites. There is a slight positive correlation between bulk FeO(*) and MgO if individual thin sections are used to derive the mineral composition versus modal olivine regressions, but the large sizes and heterogeneous distributions of phases within abyssal peridotites make it unlikely that individual thin section modes accurately reflect phase proportions in meter-sized dredge-haul samples. The variability of Na and Ti contents in pyroxenes from plagioclase-free abyssal peridotites suggests to us, as it has to other workers, that a majority of these samples interacted to varying degrees with small amounts of melt. On the other hand, lower bounds on Na and Ti contents in the pyroxenes at a given dredge site as a function of modal olivine content are broadly consistent with calculated partial melting residues. Thus, abyssal peridotites may retain information both on the original partial melting process and on concurrent or later interactions with partial melts from other sources.},

 abstract = {Advances in analytical geochemistry have made it possible to determine precisely the concentration of many trace elements and their isotopes in rocks. These data provide the cornerstone for geochemical models of the Earth and terrestrial planets. However, our understanding of how trace elements behave has not kept pace with the analytical advances. As a result, geochemists are often hampered in their interpretation of geochemical data by an incomplete knowledge of trace element partitioning under the conditions of interest. Through advances in trace element microbeam analysis it is now possible to determine partition coefficients experimentally under important conditions, such as during melting of the crust and mantle. This large body of experimental data can be used to investigate the fundamental controls on element partitioning. Simple continuum theories of elastic strain and point charges in crystal lattices, that account, respectively, for mismatch in ionic radius and ionic charge between the substituent trace ion and the lattice site on which it is accommodated, provide a very useful theoretical framework. This approach can be used as the basis for quantitative models of trace element partitioning, in terms of pressure, temperature, redox state and composition, and as a means of predicting partition coefficients for elements not routinely analysed. Experimental studies of partitioning are supported by atomistic computer simulations at zero K. Developments in computational techniques that enable direct simulation of high temperature and pressure mineral-melt partitioning will revolutionise the field in the near future. Use of novel, spectroscopic techniques to probe the structural environment of trace elements in crystals and glasses will provide valuable new data for computational and theoretical models. Extension of high temperature partitioning theory to ambient conditions is an essential step in understanding current climate change proxies, and tackling a host of environmental problems. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Bohannon1995,
 abstract = {The Pacific plate moved northwest relative to North America since 42 Ma. The rapid half rate of Pacific-Farallon spreading allowed the ridge to approach the continent at about 29 Ma. Extinct spreading ridges that occur offshore along 65{\%} of the margin (Lonsdale, 1991) document that fragments of the subducted Farallon slab became captured by the Pacific plate and assumed its motion prior to the actual subduction of the spreading ridge. This platecapture process can be used to explain much of the post29 Ma Cordilleran North America extension, strike slip, and the inland jump of oceanic spreading in the Gulf of California. The Pacific and North American contact zone lengthened with each successive plate capture event, underpinning the parts of western North America directly inland with a strong plate undergoing Pacific relative motion. We suggest that much of the post29 Ma continental tectonism is the result of the strong traction imposed on the deep part of the continental crust by the gently inclined slab of subducted oceanic lithosphere as it moved to the northwest relative to the overlying continent. The platecapture hypothesis is distinctly different from theories involving shallow slab gaps. Kinematic problems associated with shallow slab-gap models cause us to question them. This conclusion is consistent with seismic refraction interpretations that suggest there is an inclined layer with high velocities like that of basalt or gabbro at the base of the continental crust beneath much of the Californian margin and the documented reduction of slab-pull forces and density associated with young subducting slabs. Thermal and rheologic modeling suggests that coastal California was a strong zone at all depths allowing it to be firmly linked to Pacific motion. Our model shows that deformed regions such as the basin and range and borderland provinces developed in predicted weak parts of the crustal section, but they have been incompletely linked to the deep plate across the ductile middle and lower crustal layer.},

 abstract = {Plagioclase peridotites are important markers of processes that characterize the petrological and tectonic evolution of the lithospheric mantle in extensional tectonic settings. Studies on equilibrated plagioclase peridotites have documented continuous chemical changes in mantle minerals in response to plagioclase crystallization, potentially tracing the re-equilibration of mantle peridotites up to very low pressure. This experimental study provides new constraints on the stability of plagioclase in mantle peridotites as a function of bulk composition, and the compositional and modal changes in minerals occurring within the plagioclase stability field as a function of P-T-bulk composition. Subsolidus experiments have been performed at pressures ranging from 0{\{}middle dot{\}}25 to 1{\{}middle dot{\}}0 GPa, and temperatures ranging from 900 to 1200{\{}degrees{\}}C on fertile and depleted anhydrous lherzolites modelled in the system TiO2-Cr2O3-Na2O-CaO-FeO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (Ti,Cr-NCFMAS). In the fertile lherzolite (Na2O/CaO = 0{\{}middle dot{\}}08; XCr = 0{\{}middle dot{\}}07) a plagioclase-bearing assemblage is stable up to 0{\{}middle dot{\}}7 GPa, 1000{\{}degrees{\}}C and 0{\{}middle dot{\}}8 GPa, 1100{\{}degrees{\}}C, whereas in the depleted lherzolite (Na2O/CaO = 0{\{}middle dot{\}}09; XCr = 0{\{}middle dot{\}}10) the upper limit of plagioclase stability is shifted to lower pressure. The boundary between plagioclase lherzolite and spinel lherzolite has a positive slope in P-T space. In a complex chemical system, the plagioclase-out boundary is multivariant and sensitive to the XCr value [XCr = Cr/(Cr + Al)] of spinel. This latter is controlled by the reaction MgCr2O4 + CaAl2Si2O8 = MgCrAlSiO6 + CaCrAlSiO6, which is a function of the Cr-Al partitioning between spinel and pyroxenes, and varies with the XCr value and chromite/anorthite normative ratio of the bulk composition. Within the plagioclase stability field, the Al content of pyroxenes decreases, coupled with an increase in the anorthite content in plagioclase, and Ti and XCr in spinel with decreasing pressure; these chemical variations are combined with systematic changes in modal mineralogy governed by a continuous reaction involving both plagioclase and spinel. As a consequence, the composition of plagioclase varies significantly over a rather narrow pressure range and is similar at the same P-T conditions in the investigated bulk-rocks. This suggests the potential application of plagioclase composition as a geobarometer for plagioclase peridotites.},

@article{Brady2006,
 abstract = {Geochemical analyses and geobarometric determinations have been combined to create a depth vs. radiogenic heat production database for the Sierra Nevada batholith, California. This database shows that mean heat production values first increase, then decrease, with increasing depth. Heat production is ???2 ??W/m3 within the ???3-km-thick volcanic pile at the top of the batholith, below which it increases to an average value of ???3.5 ??W/m3 at ???5.5 km depth, then decreases to ???0.5-1 ??W/m3 at ???15 km depth and remains at these values through the entire crust below 15 km. Below the crust, from depths of ???40-125 km, the batholith's root and mantle wedge that coevolved beneath the batholith appears to have an average radiogenic heat production rate of ???0.14 ??W/m3. This is higher than the rates from most published xenolith studies, but reasonable given the presence of crustal components in the arc root assemblages. The pattern of radiogenic heat production interpreted from the depth vs. heat production database is not consistent with the downward-decreasing exponential distribution predicted from modeling of surface heat flow data. The interpreted distribution predicts a reasonable range of geothermal gradients and shows that essentially all of the present day surface heat flow from the Sierra Nevada could be generated within the ???35 km thick crust. This requires a very low heat flux from the mantle, which is consistent with a model of cessation of Sierran magmatism during Laramide flat-slab subduction, followed by conductive cooling of the upper mantle for ???70 m.y. The heat production variation with depth is principally due to large variations in uranium and thorium concentration; potassium is less variable in concentration within the Sierran crust, and produces relatively little of the heat in high heat production rocks. Because silica content is relatively constant through the upper ???30 km of the Sierran batholith, while U, Th, and K concentrations are highly variable, radiogenic heat production does not vary directly with silica content. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {The approach of a buoyant spreading ridge to a subduction zone may lead to detachment of a subducted slab. Previous work has called upon the detachment process as an explanation for observed ridge abandonment and slab window related magmatism (e.g., in Baja California), but such a scenario has not been tested using fully dynamic numerical models. We use dynamic two-dimensional models including a non-Newtonian rheology to study the approach of a trench-parallel spreading ridge to a subduction zone. We find that before the ridge approaches within 100 km of the trench, detachment of the subducted slab occurs due to the combined effects of increased buoyancy and reduced strength of the lithosphere with ridge proximity. In models exploring effects of subducted slab length, distance of the ridge from the trench, shear zone strength, and lithospheric yield strength, we find the following: (1) a decrease in subduction velocity as the ridge approaches the trench, (2) a shrinking surface plate that maintains a uniform plate-like subduction velocity, (3) ridge abandonment distances 100–275 km from the trench, and (4) slab gap distances 195–285 km from the trench. These results are consistent with observations in Baja California, where detachment of the Cocos slab may explain abandonment of observed segments of the East Pacific Rise 50–200 km outboard of the trench and the presence of nonarc related magmatism located 100–250 km inboard of the trench. Ridge subduction does not occur within any of these two-dimensional cases of ridge-trench collision, indicating that 3-D geometric effects may be responsible for ridge subduction.},

 abstract = {Thermomechanical models of mantle lithosphere removal from beneath the southern Sierra Nevada region, California (USA), predict a complex spatiotemporal pattern of vertical surface displacements. We evaluate these models by using (U-Th)/He thermochronometry, together with other paleothermometry estimates, to investigate such topographic transients. We target Tertiary strata from the Kern arch, a crescent-shaped active uplift located in the southeastern San Joaquin Basin, along the western fl ank of the southern Sierra Nevada. Kern arch stratigraphy provides a unique record of subsidence and exhumation in a sensitive region immediately adjacent to the delaminating mantle lithosphere at depth. Detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages from Oligocene-Miocene sandstones collected in Kern arch well cores indicate postdepositional heating to temperatures beyond those corresponding with their present burial depths. When integrated with available geologic and stratigraphic constraints, temperature-time modeling of thermo chronometric data suggests partial He loss from apatites at temperatures of 70-90°C, followed by exhumation to present burial temperatures of 35-60°C since ca. 6 Ma. By constraining the late Cenozoic geothermal gradient to {\~{}}25°C/km, our results imply 1.0-1.6 km of rapid ({\~{}}0.4 mm/yr) subsidence and sedimentation, and then subsequent uplift and exhumation of southeastern San Joaquin Basin strata in latest Miocene-Quaternary time. Stratigraphic and geomorphic relations further constrain the principal burial episode to ca. 2.5 Ma or later, and exhumation to ca. 1 Ma or later. Subtle differences in the maximum temperatures achieved in various wells may refl ect differing degrees of tectonic subsidence and sedimentation as a function of growth faulting and distance from the range front. Our results are consistent with estimates of surface subsidence and uplift from Sierran delamination models, which predict a minimum of {\~{}}0.7 km of tectonic subsidence in regions retaining mantle lithosphere adjacent to the area of delamination, and a minimum of {\~{}}0.8 km of rock uplift in regions where delamination occurred recently. We attribute the marked pulse of tectonic subsidence in the San Joaquin Basin to viscous coupling between the lower crust and a downwelling mass in the delaminating slab. The ensuing episode of exhumation is interpreted to result from the northwestward peeling back of the slab and the associated replacement of dense lithosphere with buoyant asthenosphere that drove rapid rock and surface uplift. {\textcopyright} 2014 Geological Society of America.},

 abstract = {Episodes of middle Cenozoic near-trench volcanism in California ocurred$\backslash$nduring the transition from convergent to transform plate boundaries as$\backslash$nsegments of the East Pacific Rise intersected a subduction zone along$\backslash$nwestern North America. Geochemical features of volcanic rocks from the$\backslash$nCoast Range Province and Santa Maria Province, which represent two$\backslash$nnear-trench volcanic episodes, indicate that magmas from each province$\backslash$nwere derived from depleted mantle and evolved by assimilation-fractional$\backslash$ncrystallization processes to form predominantly bimodal suites. Basalt$\backslash$nand basaltic andesite from both provinces yielded epsilon(Nd)(t) values$\backslash$nbetween +9.3 and +2.4 and Sr-87/Sr-86(t) ratios of 0.702 58-0.706 72. $\backslash$nThe observed epsilon(Nd)(t) values that cluster around +9 and the$\backslash$nSr-87/Sr-86(t) ratios {\textless} 0.7029 imply a source of depleted mantle,$\backslash$nanalogous to mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB) sources, for these rocks. $\backslash$nTh/Ta and Ba/Ta ratios as low as 0.49 and 35.78, respectively, for the$\backslash$nbasalt are similar to those of MORB and also suggest a magma source from$\backslash$ndepleted mantle. Acidic rocks, including rhyolite, dacite, and trachyte$\backslash$nsamples have epsilon(Nd)(t) values between +6.3 and -3.2 and$\backslash$nSr-87/Sr-86(t) ratios of 0.703 93 to 0.711 31. The variation among the$\backslash$nCoast Range and Santa Maria Provinces volcanic rocks in Nd-Sr isotope$\backslash$nratio space suggests that mixing occurred between the depleted$\backslash$nmantle-derived basaltic end-member and an incompatible-element-enriched$\backslash$ncrustal reservoir through which these rocks erupted. The observed$\backslash$nnegative correlation of epsilon(Nd)(t) and positive correlation of$\backslash$nSr-87/Sr-86(t) ratios with SiO2, respectively, also suggest assimilation$\backslash$nof an isotopically distinct crustal component by depleted mantle-derived$\backslash$nmelts. The ages and palegeographic distributions of these volcanic$\backslash$nrocks indicate that they were erupted during episodes when segments of$\backslash$nthe East Pacific Rise intersected southern California. Depleted mantle$\backslash$nthat was emplaced beneath the continental margin during ridge subduction$\backslash$nbecame a source of magma for the episodes of near-trench volcanism as a$\backslash$nnew strike-slip regime evolved along the continental margin.},

 abstract = {Apatite (U-Th)/He ages from a vertical transect through the Santa Lucia Mountains, central California Coast Ranges, are used to reconstruct the history of exhumation and of bedrock and surface uplift in this region since ca. 6 Ma. We find a direct correlation between (U-Th)/He ages and elevation, which we interpret to correspond to denudation rates of approximately 0.35 mm/yr between 6 and 2 Ma. The onset of bedrock uplift and exhumation ca. 6 Ma followed a change in plate motion ca. 8 Ma. After 2 Ma, denudation rates increased substantially ( approximately 0.9 mm/yr). This is a rare instance in which long-term average bedrock ( approximately 0.85 mm/yr) and surface ( approximately 0.20 mm/yr) uplift can be calculated from denudation rates and stratigraphic data. The post-2 Ma denudation rate is about one order of magnitude higher than independently determined river erosion rates in the area. We suggest that this discrepancy indicates that exhumation of the steep western slopes of this segment of the Coast Ranges has been dominated by mass wasting via landslides, rather than fluvial erosion, at least since ca. 2 Ma. We also show that the bedrock uplift is predominantly tectonic, not isostatic.},

 abstract = {Continental magmatic arcs form above subduction zones where the upper plate is continental lithosphere and/or accreted transitional lithosphere. The best-studied examples are found along the western margin of the Americas. They are Earth's largest sites of intermediate magmatism. They are long lived (tens to hundreds of millions of years) and spatially complex; their location migrates laterally due to a host of tectonic causes. Episodes of crustal and lithospheric thickening alternating with periods of root foundering produce cyclic vertical changes in arcs. The average plutonic and volcanic rocks in these arcs straddle the compositional boundary between an andesite and a dacite, very similar to that of continental crust; about half of that comes from newly added mafic material from the mantle. Arc products of the upper crust differentiated from deep crustal ({\textgreater}40 km) residual materials, which are unstable in the lithosphere. Continental arcs evolve into stable continental masses over time; trace elemental budgets, however, present challenges to the concept that Phanerozoic arcs are the main factories of continental crust.},

 abstract = {Major element, trace element, and isotopic data from late Cenozoic alkali basalts comprising the Cima volcanic field, southeastern California, are used to characterize basalt sources beneath this portion of the Mojave Desert over the past 8 m.y. The basalts are dominantly trachybasalts with trace element compositions similar to modern ocean-island basalts (GIB), regardless of the presence or absence of mantle-derived xenoliths. In detail, the basalts can be divided into three groups based on their ages and on their trace element and isotopic characteristics. Those basalts {\textless}1 m.y. in age, and the majority of those 3-5 m.y. old, belong to Group 1 defined by high epsilon Nd values (7.6 to 9.3), low Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.7028 to 0.7040), low whole rock delta(18)O (5.8 parts per thousand to 6.4 parts per thousand), and a restricted range of Pb isotopic compositions that generally plot on the mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORE) portion of the northern hemisphere reference line. The 3 to 5-m.y.-old basalts have rare earth element (REE) and other incompatible element abundances that increase regularly with decreasing {\%}MgO and apparently have undergone more extensive differentiation than the younger, {\textless}1 m.y.-old basalts. The Group 2 and 3 basalts are minor constituents of the preserved volcanic material, but are consistently older (5-7.6 m.y.) and have lower epsilon Nd (5.1 to 7.5) values than the Group 1 basalts. These basalts have distinctive trace element signatures, with the Group 2 basalts having higher Ni, lower Hf, and slightly lower middle REE abundances than the Group 1 basalts, while the Group 3 basalts are characterized by higher and more fractionated REE abundances, as well as higher Ca, P, Ti, Th, Ta, and Sc contents. The isotopic and trace element characteristics of all the basalts are interpreted to have been largely inherited from their mantle source regions. The isotopic compositions of the Group 1 basalts overlap the values for Pacific MORE and for late Cenozoic basalts in the California Coast Ranges interpreted to have been derived from upwelling MORE asthenosphere. We suggest that the Group 1 basalts were all derived from light REE (LREE)-enriched portions of the Pacific MORE source, which rose into the slab ''gap'' that developed beneath the southwestern United States during the late Cenozoic transition from a convergent to a transform plate margin. The Group 2 and 3 basalts either represent smaller degrees of melting of the MORE source, or melting of mafic portions of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle currently present beneath the region. Ancient, LREE-enriched mantle lithosphere has not been a primary source of basaltic magmatism in this region at any time over the past 8 m.y.},

@article{Frey1978,
 abstract = {Ultramafic inclusions from San Carlos, Arizona, are classified into two groups. Group I inclusions are dominated by magnesian (Mg/Mg + $\Sigma$Fe = 0.86 – 0.91), olivine-rich peridotites containing Cr-rich clinopyroxene and spinel. The less abundant Group I pyroxenites (containing Mg- and Cr-rich pyroxenes) occur as discrete inclusions and as portions of composite inclusions where they have a sharp, planar interface with lherzolite. Group II inclusions are dominated by clinopyroxene-rich peridotites containing Al- and Ti-rich augite and commonly abundant, Al-rich spinel. Compared to Group I inclusions, they are more Fe-rich (Mg/Mg + $\Sigma$Fe = 0.62 – 0.78) and more hetereogeneous in composition and modal proportions. Similar groups occur at many ultramafic inclusion localities. Our petrographic and geochemical results lead to the following conclusions. Olivine-rich Group I inclusions are not genetically related to the host basanite, and they are formed from two components. Component A is a partial melting residue; it comprises the major portion of these inclusions and determines the modal mineralogy and major and compatible trace element composition. Component B results from a small degree ({\textless}5{\%}) of garnet peridotite melting (probably, within the low-velocity zone). This highly LIL-element-enriched melt has migrated upwards into the overlying component A where it crystallized primarily as clinopyroxene and amphibole, and thus, introduced LIL elements into the residual component A. Subsequent cooling and subsolidus recrystallization have removed textural evidence of this mixing. This model has also been proposed for olivine-rich Group I inclusions from Victoria, Australia. At Victoria and San Carlos some relatively clinopyroxene-rich Group I lherzolites are not contaminated by component B, and they represent the best estimates of upper mantle composition prior to melting. Group I orthopyroxenites may be fragments of tectonic layers formed in lherzolite, but they could also be early cumulates (now metamorphosed) from the melt in equilibrium with component A. Group I clinopyroxenites have geochemical features of clinopyroxene in equilibrium with a magma. Thus, they could also represent early cumulates (now metamorphosed) from a magma unrelated to the host basanite. Alternatively, their geochemical characteristics could result from more complex models such as residues from partial remelting of pyroxenite dikes and veins or intradike segregation processes such as filter pressing. All Group II inclusions studied appear to be cumulates derived from a SiO2-undersaturated magma, possibly an early magma in the same volcanic episode which culminated with eruption of the host basanite. The poikilitic texture of amphibole-rich (kaersutite) inclusions is consistent with a cumulate origin. The bulk compositions of Group II inclusions are not equivalent to typical basaltic compositions.},

 abstract = {Forty two major (Na, Mg, Ti and Mn) and trace elements covering the mass range from Li to U in three USGS basalt glass reference materials BCR-2G, BHVO-2G and BIR-1G were determined using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Calibration was performed using NIST SRM 610 in conjunction with internal standardisation using Ca. Determinations were also made on NIST SRM 612 and 614 as well as NIST SRM 610 as unknown samples, and included forty five major (Al and Na) and trace elements. Relative standard deviation (RSD) of determinations was below 10{\%} for most elements in all the glasses under investigation. Consistent exceptions were Sn and Sb in BCR-2G, BHVO-2G and BIR-1G. For BCR-2G, BHVO-2G and BIR-1G, clear negative correlations on a logarithmic scale exist between RSD and concentration for elements lower than 1500 µg g-1 with logarithmic correlation coefficients between -0.75 and -0.86. There is also a clear trend of increasing RSD with decreasing concentration from NIST SRM 610 through SRM 612 to SRM 614. These suggest that the difference in the scatter of apparent element concentrations is not due to chemical heterogeneity but reflects analytical uncertainty. It is concluded that all these glasses are, overall, homogeneous on a scale of 60 µm.  Our first results on BHVO-2G and BIR-1G showed that they generally agreed with BHVO-2/BHVO-1 and BIR-1 within 10{\%} relative. Exceptions were Nb, Ta and Pb in BHVO-2G, which were 14-45{\%} lower than reference values for BHVO-2 and BHVO-1. Be, Ni, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Sn, Sb, Gd, Tb, Er, Pb and U in BIR-1G were also exceptions. However, of these elements, Be, Nb, Sn, Sb, Gd, Tb, Pb and U gave results that were consistent within an uncertainty of 2s between our data and BIR-1 reference values. Results on NIST SRM 612 agreed well with published data, except for Mg and Sn. This was also true for elements with m/z {\textgreater} 85 (Rb) in the case of NIST SRM 614.},

@article{Gilbert2012,
 abstract = {Tomographic studies of the mantle of southern California (USA) commonly found evidence for seismically high speed material, known as the Isabella anomaly, extending from near the base of the crust of the southwestern Sierra Nevada foothills into the asthenosphere. This anomaly has been interpreted to mark downwelling lithospheric material that had been removed from the southern Sierra Nevada. Using data from the Sierra Nevada EarthScope Project (SNEP) array, we investigate the lithosphere of the Sierra Nevada and surrounding region to better understand the process by which batholiths form dense lithospheric roots that become unstable and founder. Inverting phase velocities of fundamental mode Rayleigh waves for shear wave speeds provides observations of the distribution of high and low wave-speed anomalies, which correspond to portions of the batholith that formed an intact lithospheric root, and where seismically slower shallow asthenosphere marks areas where lithosphere has been removed. Our results corroborate previous observations that the southern Sierra Nevada has thin crust underlain by shallow asthenosphere. High shear wave velocity (Vs) material in the mantle beneath the southwestern foothills marks the location of the Isabella anomaly, to the east of which is a region of low Vs mantle where asthenosphere has risen to replace the delaminating root. Farther north, near the latitude of Long Valley, low velocities at shallow depths beneath the high elevations of the eastern Sierra indicate the presence of asthenosphere close to the base of the crust. Thicker high-speed material, however, underlies the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada at this latitude and dips to the east where it extends to depths of ∼100 km or more, giving it the appearance of a portion of lithosphere that has detached from the east but remains attached to the west as it is currently peeling off. The structure of the Sierra Nevada changes near the latitude of Lake Tahoe, where thinner lithosphere extends between depths of 40 and 80 km, but does not reach greater depths. It appears that the lithospheric material of the Sierra Nevada from latitudes close to Lake Tahoe, and continuing to the north, is not being removed, indicating a change between the structure and evolution of the southern and northern Sierra Nevada.},

 abstract = {An experimental study of the stability fields at high pressure of plagioclase peridotite, aluminous pyroxene (±spinel) peridotite and garnet peridotite, has been carried out in compositions matching estimates of the average undifferentiated upper mantle (pyrolite). The appearance of garnet at high pressures results from either of two complex reactions: 1.a.|spinel+pyroxene ⇌ olivine+garnet, (solid solutions)2.b.|aluminous pyroxene ⇌ garnet+pyroxene (lower Al2O3). (solid solution) In the model pyrolite composition, garnet appears at 21 kb (1100 °C) to 24 kb (1300 °C) by reaction (a) but at temperatures above 1300 °C spinel is absent from the low pressure assemblage and garnet develops by reaction (b) at pressures of 24 kb (1300 °C) to 31 kb (1500 °C). Reactions (a) and (b) have very different P, T gradients. In the garnet peridotite field, the amount of garnet is inversely proportional to the alumina content of the pyroxenes. This is confirmed by microprobe analyses of orthopyroxene (ranging from 6.0 to 2.2{\%} Al2O3, 0.7–0.9{\%} Cr2O3) coexisting with garnet, olivine and clinopyroxene. Coexisting clinopyroxenes have higher R2O3 content and exhibit a variable, temperature dependent enstatite solid solution. The experimental data are applied to estimate mineralogical, density and seismic velocity variations along oceanic and continental geothermal gradients in a pyrolite upper mantle. Although the mineralogical variation may produce a low velocity zone, the alternate explanation of incipient or minor partial melting is preferred. Experimental data on the maximum stability limit of amphibole in pyrolite (with 0.1–0.2{\%} water) are presented showing that amphibole breaks down to olivine+pyroxenes+garnet+fluid phase at approximately 29 kb, 1000 °C. The instability of amphibole at depths {\textgreater}80–90 km is considered to result in a zone of incipient or minor melting in a pyrolite upper mantle with 0.1–0.2{\%} water. The nature of the liquid in this zone is considered to be highly undersaturated olivine basanite or olivine nephelinite.},

 abstract = {I propose that post-Laramide removal of the subhorizontally subducting Farallon slab occurred by buckling downward along an approximately east-northeast–trending axis. This process was accomplished by a tearing or necking separation of the subducted slab near the northern and southern boundaries of the United States and propagation of the separated edges toward the central axis of downwelling, accompanied by aesthenosphic upwelling behind the trailing edges. Initial buckling probably began near 50 Ma, and slab removal was complete by 20 Ma. This model is based primarily on the space-time evolution of the ‘‘ignimbrite flare-up'' (a major midTertiary igneous event of mantle origin), which involved two propagating fronts of initiation of volcanism that followed the proposed motions of the separated slab edges as they converged on central Nevada from the north and southeast. Post-Laramide uplift, extension, establishment of the Cascadia subduction zone, and active magmatism may be consequences of lithosphere-scale modifications caused by the Laramide removal of the slab and the resulting asthenospheric upwelling.},

 abstract = {We present new field, structural, petrographic, and geochronologic data on a rare midcrustal (∼25 km) exposure of a Cordilleran arc, the Coast Ridge Belt, located in the Santa Lucia Mountains of central California. The study area is composed primarily of a deformed suite of upper amphibolite to granulite facies rocks (the “Sur Series”), which is dominated by metaigneous tonalites, diorites, and gabbros with subordinate metasedimentary quartzite and marble. Inherited zircons in magmatic rocks suggest that the provenance of framework rocks is drawn heavily from miogeoclinal formations and that sedimentation occurred in the late Paleozoic or later. Minor magmatism in the Coast Ridge Belt began in the Early or Middle Cretaceous, but magmatic activity was most intense during a short period time from 93 to 81 Ma, based on U-Pb zircon ages of a felsic gneiss and two less-deformed diorites. The time period 93–81 Ma also brackets a period of extensive thickening and high-temperature ductile deformation. While a thrusting cause for ductile deformation cannot be ruled out, we favor the hypothesis that the exposed rocks correspond to a zone of return flow of supracrustal rocks locally displaced by granitoid plutons in the shallower crust. Magmatism ended throughout Salinia between 81 and 76 Ma, coincident with the attainment of peak pressure and temperature conditions of 0.75 GPa and 800°C. Exhumation followed immediately, bringing the Coast Ridge Belt to the surface within 8 My at a rate of at least 2–3 mm/yr. Exhumation was coincident with an episode of extensional collapse that has been documented elsewhere in the southern California arc during the early Laramide orogeny and that may be related to underthrusting of the forearc at that time.},

 abstract = {The position of the transition from spinel Iherzolite to garnet Iherzolite in the system CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (CMAS) has been determined experimentally at near-solidus temperatures. In reversed experiments, the transition occurs between 18 and 20 kbar at 1200 degrees C and between 26 and 27 kbar at 1500 degrees C, corresponding to higher pressures than previously envisaged. A position for the transition deeper within the Earth further complicates the explanation of the so-called garnet signatures in the trace element and isotope patterns of mid-ocean ridge basalts. If melting during adiabatic upwelling beneath a mid-ocean ridge begins at the depth required for the stability of garnet in peridotitic compositions, simple melting models predict that the amount of melt produced should be much greater than the observed thickness of the oceanic crust. A partial solution to the apparent conflict might be that (1) the rather simplistic melting models are in error, (2) that melting begins in garnet pyroxenite veins that are believed to be stable at lower pressures than garnet Iherzolite or (3) that melting does not involve garnet at all, but it is clinopyroxene causing the trace element patterns observed in basalts erupted at mid-ocean ridges. A second set of reversal experiments were conducted to investigate the solubility of alumina in both orthopyroxenes and clinopyroxenes at the high temperatures near the solidus in the system CMAS. The results are compatible with most previous studies, and may be used as a starting point to calibrate thermodynamic models for pyroxenes in chem mating upper mantle chemistry. in chemical systems, approximating upper mantle chemistry.},

 abstract = {A deterministic attitude estimation problem for a rigid body in an attitude dependent potential field with bounded measurement errors is studied. An attitude estimation scheme that does not use generalized coordinate representations of the attitude is presented here. Assuming that the initial attitude, angular velocity and measurement noise lie within given ellipsoidal bounds, an uncertainty ellipsoid that bounds the attitude and the angular velocity of the rigid body is obtained. The center of the uncertainty ellipsoid provides point estimates, and its size gives the accuracy of the estimates. The point estimates and the uncertainty ellipsoids are propagated using a Lie group variational integrator and its linearization, respectively. The estimation scheme is optimal in the sense that the attitude estimation error and the size of the uncertainty ellipsoid is minimized at each measurement instant, and it is global since the attitude is represented by a rotation matrix},

The boundary is more prominent south of the Mendocino Triple Junction, where the Farallon Plate has completely subducted.

The most attractive models invoke low-angle subduction24, which can develop for various reasons5,6. Evidence from South America indicates that one such reason may be the subduction of buoyant ocean floor. We here extend the low-angle subduction models by attributing the shallowing of the subduction angle during the Laramide orogeny to subduction of a large oceanic plateau of anomalously thick and buoyant oceanic crust. Pacific plate history indicates that a twin to the Hess Rise may represent the oceanic plateau that triggered Laramide events.},

@article{Mancktelow1997,
 abstract = {Both erosion and surface topography cause a time-dependent variation in isotherm geometry that can result in significant errors in estimating natural exhumation rates from geochronologic data. Analytical solutions and two-dimensional numerical modelling are used to investigate the magnitude of these inaccuracies for conditions appropriate to many rapidly exhumed mountain chains of rugged relief. It is readily demonstrated that uplift of the topographic surface has a negligible effect on the cooling history of an exhumed rock sample and cannot be quantified by current geochronologic methods. The topography itself perturbs the isotherms to a depth that depends on both the vertical and horizontal scale of the surface relief. Estimations employing different isotopic systems in the same sample with higher closure temperatures ({\textgreater} 200{\^{A}}°C) are not generally influenced by topography. However, direct conversion of cooling rates to exhumation rates assuming a simple constant linear geotherm markedly underestimates peak rates, due to variation of the geothermal gradient in time and space and to the time lag between exhumation and cooling. Estimations based on the altitude variation in apatite fission-track ages are less prone to such inaccuracies in geothermal gradient but are affected by near-surface time-dependent variation in isotherm depth due to advection and topography. In tectonically active mountain belts, high exhumation rates are coupled with rugged topography, and exhumation rates may be markedly overestimated, by factors of 2 or more. Even at lower exhumation rates on the order of 1 mm/a, the shape of the cooling curve is modified by advection and topography. A convex-concave shape to the cooling curve does not necessarily imply a change of exhumation rate; it may also be attained by a more complicated geothermal gradient induced by topographic relief. Very fast cooling below 100{\^{A}}°C, often interpreted as reflecting faster exhumation, can be more simply explained by the lateral cooling effect of topographic relief, with samples exhumed in valleys displaying a different near-surface cooling history to those on ridge crests.},

 abstract = {Reprocessed deep-penetration seismic reflection profiles across the offshore southern Santa Maria Basin suggest a complex history of tectonic deformation. The top of subducted oceanic crust, imaged at the north end of EDGE line RU-10, is disrupted and eventually disappears to the south. Farther south, a strong lower crustal reflection ramps up and may reflect a possible north-dipping low-angle detachment, or a change in crustal geometry associated with the subducted Morro Fracture Zone. Above a time-transgressive unconformity, Miocene and younger sediments onlap to the south and water bottom deepens, suggesting a major regional tilt reversal in post-Miocene time. Below the unconformity, basement is displaced by largely northwest-striking normal faults that we believe form tilted crustal blocks; it is possible that Cretaceous and Paleogene sections are preserved in resulting half-grabens. Some of these normal faults, including splays off the outer Santa Lucia Bank fault system, were reactivated as minor reverse faults in post-Miocene time. There is no evidence that requires any post-17.5 Ma tectonostratigraphic terrane boundary through this area; rather, much of the structure of the southern Santa Maria Basin appears to be continuous with the rotated Western Transverse Ranges and northern Channel Islands.},

 abstract = {The proton microprobe has been used to determine contents of Ca, Ti, Ni, Mn and Zn in the olivine of 54 spinel lherzolite xenoliths from Australian and Chinese basalts. These data are compared with proton-probe data for Ni, Mn and Zn in the olivine of 180 garnet peridotite xenoliths from African and Siberian kimberlites. Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn contents are well-correlated; because the spinel lherzolite olivines have higher mean Fe contents than garnet peridotite olivines (average Fo (sub 89.6) vs. Fo (sub 90-92) ) they also have lower Ni and higher Mn contents. Zn and Fe are well-correlated in garnet peridotite olivine, but in spinel peridotites this relationship is perturbed by partitioning of Zn into spinel. None of these elements shows significant correlation with temperature. Consistent differences in trace-element contents of olivines in the two suites is interpreted as reflecting the greater degree of depletion of Archean garnet peridotites as compared to Phanerozoic spinel lherzolites. Ca and Ti contents of spinel-peridotite olivine are well correlated with one another, and with temperature as determined by several types of geothermometer. However, Ca contents are poorly correlated with pressure as determined by the Ca-in-olivine barometer of Koehler and Brey (1990). This reflects the strong T-dependence of this barometer: the uncertainty in pressure (calculated by this method) which is produced by the + or -50 degrees C uncertainty expected of any geothermometer is ca + or -8 kbar, corresponding to the entire width of the spinel-lherzolite field at 900-1200 degrees C.},

 abstract = {The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) represents the base of the Earth's lithosphere, the rigid and relatively cool outer shell characterised by a conductive thermal regime, isolated from the convecting asthenosphere. Chemically, the LAB should divide a lithospheric mantle that is variably depleted in basaltic components from a more fertile asthenosphere. In xenolith suites from cratonic areas, the bottom of the depleted lithosphere is marked by a rapid downward increase in elements such as Fe, Ca, Al, Ti, Zr and Y, and a rapid decrease in the median Mg{\#} of olivine, reflecting the infiltration of mafic melts and related fluids. Eclogites and related mafic and carbonatitic crystallisation products are concentrated at the same depths as the maximum degrees of metasomatism, and may represent the melts responsible for this refertilisation of the lithosphere. This refertilised zone, at depths of ca 170-220. km beneath Archean and Proterozoic cratons, is unlikely to represent a true LAB. Re-Os isotopic studies of the deepest fertile peridotite xenoliths show that they retain evidence of ancient depletion events; seismic tomography data show high-velocity material extending to much greater depths beneath cratons. The cratonic "LAB" probably represents a level where asthenospheric melts have ponded and refertilised the lithosphere, rather than marking a transition to the convecting asthenosphere. Our only deeper samples are rare diamond inclusions and some xenoliths inverted from majoritic garnet, which are unlikely to represent the bulk composition of the asthenosphere.In younger continental regions the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is shallower (commonly at about 80-100. km). In regions of extension and lithosphere thinning (e.g. eastern China, eastern Australia, Mongolia), upwelling asthenosphere may cool to form the lowermost lithosphere, and may be represented by xenoliths of fertile garnet peridotites in alkali basalts. The LAB is a movable boundary. It may become shallower due to thermal and chemical erosion of the lithosphere, assisted by extension. Refertilised lithospheric sections, especially where peridotites are intermixed with eclogite, may be capable of gravitational delamination. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary may also be deepened by subcretion of upwelling hot mantle (e.g. plumes). This process may be recorded in the strongly layered lithospheric mantle sections seen in the Slave Craton (Canada), northern Michigan (USA) and the Gawler Craton (Australia). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {This classification of spinel facies ultramafic xenoliths is based on thin-section criteria, and encompasses rocks of all modal compositions. It distinguishes textures which are unambiguously igneous or metamorphic and divides metamorphic textures into four distinct types: porphyroclastic, cataclastic, foliated and equigranular mosaic. A separate category, allotriomorphic-granular, refers principally to coase-grained textures that are of unclear origin. In addition, textures that are dominated by partial melting are distinguished from igneous types. Interpretation of xenolith textures by reference to textures formed under experimental conditions is limited by lack of information about many of the factors which control xenolith textures. Until the effect of these factors is better understood, there can be no reliable completely genetic classification of xenolith textures.},

@article{Pollack1977,
 abstract = {Geotherm families in which surface heat flow is the principal independent variable have been constructed for continental and oceanic lithospheres. The continental model is characterized by geotherms in which surface heat flow is in equilibrium with heat flowing into the lithosphere at its base plus heat generated by radioactive decay within the lithosphere. The model accommodates the regional variation of the surface heat flow with proportional variations in the radioactivity of the surficial enriched zone and in the deeper heat flow. The proportionality is dictated by a new and general linear relationship between reduced heat flow and mean heat flow for a region (q* ??? 0.6 q ??0), which enables both q* and the mean heat production of the enriched zone to be estimated from knowledge of the mean surface heat flow of a province. The oceanic model is characterized by the transient cooling of a semi-infinite medium with an initial temperature gradient and some near-surface radiogenic heat production. The model yields a heat flow in satisfactory agreement with observations in the oldest ocean basins. The depth at which both the oceanic and continental geotherms reach {\~{}}0.85 of the melting temperature is shown to be a consistent estimator of the depth to the top of the low-velocity channel, or the thickness of the high-velocity lid overlying the channel. We identify the lid as synonymous with the lithosphere, and produce a global map of lithospheric thickness based on the regional variation of surface heat flow. The lithosphere is less than 100 km thick over most of the globe, but thickens appreciably and becomes more viscous beneath the Precambrian shields and platforms, regions of low heat flow. These characteristics of shields are consistent with recently reported models of the driving mechanisms of the plate system, which require greater retarding forces beneath plates with large continental areas. ?? 1977.},

@article{Robinson1998,
 abstract = {We have determined the pressure and temperature of the spinel-garnet transition close to the solidus of fertile and depleted peridotite from a combination of synthesis, sandwich and garnet-seeded experiments. Garnet is unstable in MORB-Pyrolite below 2.8 GPa (depths {\textless}85 km) at a solidus temperature of 1470°C. In Tinaquillo Lherzolite, which is related to MORB-Pyrolite by about 7{\%} fractional melting, the transformation occurs at 3.1 GPa at a solidus temperature of 1520°C. In both cases the transformation interval is narrow, approximately 0.1-0.2 GPa. Because the solidus temperature increases by 7°C and the spinel-garnet transformation pressure by 0.05 GPa for every 1{\%} melt extracted, extremely high potential temperatures (T(p) {\textgreater} 1450°C) are required to generate the 3-5{\%} melting in the garnet field implied by recent trace element and isotope studies. It appears likely, therefore, that the 'garnet signature' arises from some mechanism other than anhydrous melting of garnet peridotite.},

 abstract = {The distribution of rare earth elements (REE) between clinopyroxene (cpx) and basaltic melt is important in deciphering the processes of mantle melting. REE and Y partition coefficients from a given cpx-melt partitioning experiment can be quantitatively described by the lattice strain model. We analyzed published REE and Y parti- tioning data between cpx and basaltic melts using the nonlinear regression method and parameterized key parti- tioning parameters in the lattice strain model (D0, r0 and E) as functions of pressure, temperature, and compositions of cpx and melt. D0 is found to positively correlate with Al in tetrahedral site (AlT) and Mg in the M2 site (MgM2)of cpx and negatively correlate with temperature and water content in the melt. r0 is negatively correlated with Al in M1 site (AlM1) and MgM2 in cpx. And E is positively correlated with r0. During adiabatic melting of spinel lherzolite, temperature, AlT, and MgM2 in cpx all decrease systematically as a function of pressure or degree of melting. The competing effects between temperature and cpx composition result in very small variations in REE partition coefficients along a mantle adiabat. A higher potential temperature (1,400?C) gives rise to REE partition coefficients slightly lower than those at a lower potential temperature (1,300?C) because the temperature effect overwhelms the compositional effect. A set of constant REE partition coefficients therefore may be used to accu- rately model REE fractionation during partial melting of spinel lherzolite along a mantle adiabat. As cpx has low Al and Mg abundances at high temperature during melting in the garnet stability field, REE are more incompatible in cpx. Heavy REE depletion in the melt may imply deep melting of a hydrous garnet lherzolite. Water-dependent cpx partition coefficients need to be considered for mod- eling low-degree hydrous melting.},

Possible effects of the existence and migration of slab windows on the Cordillera at various times include cessation of arc volcanism and replacement by rift or plate- edge volcanism; lithospheric uplift, attenuation, and extension; and increased intensity of compressional tectonism. Eocene extensional tectonism and alkaline magmatism in southern British Columbia and the northwestern United States were facilitated by slab-window development.},

 abstract = {Seismic reflection and refraction data from the Coast Ranges of central California west of the San Andreas fault suggest the presence of a low-velocity (4.5–5.0 km/s) wedge at a depth of about 15–22 km that dips east beneath rocks of both the Franciscan assemblage and the Salinian block. We propose that the wedge represents sedimentary materials that were subducted in an offshore trench within the past 23 m.y. The refraction data also suggest the presence of a second low-velocity zone that extends at least to mid-crustal depths beneath the San Andreas fault zone.},

@article{Vila2010,
 abstract = {Determining the temperature distribution within the lithosphere requires the knowledge of the radiogenic heat production (RHP) distribution within the crust and the lithospheric mantle. RHP of crustal rocks varies considerably at different scales as a result of the petrogenetic processes responsible for their formation and therefore RHP depends on the considered lithologies. In this work we address RHP variability of some common lithological groups from a compilation of a total of 2188 representative U, Th and K concentrations of different worldwide rock types derived from 102 published studies. To optimize the use of the generated RHP database we have classified and renamed the rock-type denominations of the original works following a petrologic classification scheme with a hierarchical structure. The RHP data of each lithological group is presented in cumulative distribution plots, and we report a table with the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum and maximum values, and the significant percentiles of these lithological groups. We discuss the reported RHP distribution for the different igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic lithological groups from a petrogenetic viewpoint and give some useful guidelines to assign RHP values to lithospheric thermal modeling. ?? 2010.},

@article{Wang2013,
 abstract = {As the Pacific-Farallon spreading center approached North America, the Farallon plate fragmented into a number of small plates. Some of the microplate fragments ceased subducting before the spreading center reached the trench. Most tectonic models have assumed that the subducting oceanic slab detached from these microplates close to the trench, but recent seismic tomography studies have revealed a high-velocity anomaly beneath Baja California that appears to be a fossil slab still attached to the Guadalupe and Magdalena microplates. Here, using surface wave tomography, we establish the lateral extent of this fossil slab and show that it is correlated with the distribution of high-Mg andesites thought to derive from partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust. We also reinterpret the high seismic velocity anomaly beneath the southern central valley of California as another fossil slab extending to a depth of 200 km or more that is attached to the former Monterey microplate. The existence of these fossil slabs may force a reexamination of models of the tectonic evolution of western North America over the last 30 My.},

@article{Wilson2005,
 abstract = {The geologic record of coastal California includes evidence of numerous volcanic centers younger than 30 Ma that do not appear to have erupted in an arc setting. By correlating these volcanic centers with specific slab windows predicted from analysis of magnetic anomalies on the Pacific plate, we add new constraints to tectonic reconstructions since 30 Ma. Our correlations, such as erupting the Morro Rock Islay Hill complex south of the Pioneer fracture zone and the Iversen Basalt south of the Mendocino fracture zone, require larger displacements within western North America than advocated by most previous authors. Specifically, we infer at least 315 km of motion between the Sierra Nevada and rigid North America at an azimuth of about N60 degrees W and at least 515 km between Baja California and rigid North America in a similar direction. A consequence of inferring a large displacement of Baja California is that the Pacific-North American plate boundary must have developed most of its current form prior to 10 Ma. We interpret a slab window developing between Cocos and Monterey plates after 19 Ma that reconstructs under nearly all of the southern California volcanic centers dated at 18-14 Ma. Most of the sedimentary basins associated with volcanic rocks show brief periods of rapid subsidence synchronous with volcanism, followed by slow subsidence of variable but often extended duration, consistent with rapid extension of cold lithosphere over recently introduced hot asthenosphere.},

@article{Workman2005,
 abstract = {We derive an estimate for the chemical composition of the depleted MORB mantle (DMM), the source reservoir to mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs), which represents at least 30{\%} the mass of the whole silicate Earth. A database for the chemical and physical properties of abyssal peridotites has become robust and complete enough to truly access a reference DMM. Using trace element depletion trends from the abyssal peridotites, it is possible to construct a large part of DMM's trace element pattern. Splicing this information with isotopic constraints (Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf) and canonical ratios (Ce/Pb, Nb/Ta, Nb/U, Ba/Rb, H2O/Ce, CO2/Nb and Cl/K), we can extend abundance estimates to all the incompatible elements including volatile content. The resulting trace element pattern for average DMM constrains parental MORB to be generated by 6{\%} aggregated fractional melting, consistent with recent models for hydrous melting of the mantle [P.D. Asimow, J.E. Dixon, C.H. Langmuir, A hydrous melting and fractionation model for mid-ocean ridge basalts: application to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near the Azores, Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst. 5 (2004) 10.1029/2003GC000568]. We show that DMM is roughly balanced by the continental crust and better balanced upon inclusion of ocean island basalt source and oceanic crust components. Compared to the primitive mantle, DMM has been depleted by 2-3{\%} melt extraction and has only 15{\%} the radiogenic heat production. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
