@article{Bohannon1995,
 abstract = {The Pacific plate moved northwest relative to North America since 42 Ma. The rapid half rate of Pacific-Farallon spreading allowed the ridge to approach the continent at about 29 Ma. Extinct spreading ridges that occur offshore along 65{\%} of the margin (Lonsdale, 1991) document that fragments of the subducted Farallon slab became captured by the Pacific plate and assumed its motion prior to the actual subduction of the spreading ridge. This platecapture process can be used to explain much of the post29 Ma Cordilleran North America extension, strike slip, and the inland jump of oceanic spreading in the Gulf of California. The Pacific and North American contact zone lengthened with each successive plate capture event, underpinning the parts of western North America directly inland with a strong plate undergoing Pacific relative motion. We suggest that much of the post29 Ma continental tectonism is the result of the strong traction imposed on the deep part of the continental crust by the gently inclined slab of subducted oceanic lithosphere as it moved to the northwest relative to the overlying continent. The platecapture hypothesis is distinctly different from theories involving shallow slab gaps. Kinematic problems associated with shallow slab-gap models cause us to question them. This conclusion is consistent with seismic refraction interpretations that suggest there is an inclined layer with high velocities like that of basalt or gabbro at the base of the continental crust beneath much of the Californian margin and the documented reduction of slab-pull forces and density associated with young subducting slabs. Thermal and rheologic modeling suggests that coastal California was a strong zone at all depths allowing it to be firmly linked to Pacific motion. Our model shows that deformed regions such as the basin and range and borderland provinces developed in predicted weak parts of the crustal section, but they have been incompletely linked to the deep plate across the ductile middle and lower crustal layer.},

@article{Brady2006,
 abstract = {Geochemical analyses and geobarometric determinations have been combined to create a depth vs. radiogenic heat production database for the Sierra Nevada batholith, California. This database shows that mean heat production values first increase, then decrease, with increasing depth. Heat production is ???2 ??W/m3 within the ???3-km-thick volcanic pile at the top of the batholith, below which it increases to an average value of ???3.5 ??W/m3 at ???5.5 km depth, then decreases to ???0.5-1 ??W/m3 at ???15 km depth and remains at these values through the entire crust below 15 km. Below the crust, from depths of ???40-125 km, the batholith's root and mantle wedge that coevolved beneath the batholith appears to have an average radiogenic heat production rate of ???0.14 ??W/m3. This is higher than the rates from most published xenolith studies, but reasonable given the presence of crustal components in the arc root assemblages. The pattern of radiogenic heat production interpreted from the depth vs. heat production database is not consistent with the downward-decreasing exponential distribution predicted from modeling of surface heat flow data. The interpreted distribution predicts a reasonable range of geothermal gradients and shows that essentially all of the present day surface heat flow from the Sierra Nevada could be generated within the ???35 km thick crust. This requires a very low heat flux from the mantle, which is consistent with a model of cessation of Sierran magmatism during Laramide flat-slab subduction, followed by conductive cooling of the upper mantle for ???70 m.y. The heat production variation with depth is principally due to large variations in uranium and thorium concentration; potassium is less variable in concentration within the Sierran crust, and produces relatively little of the heat in high heat production rocks. Because silica content is relatively constant through the upper ???30 km of the Sierran batholith, while U, Th, and K concentrations are highly variable, radiogenic heat production does not vary directly with silica content. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Burkett2009,
 abstract = {The approach of a buoyant spreading ridge to a subduction zone may lead to detachment of a subducted slab. Previous work has called upon the detachment process as an explanation for observed ridge abandonment and slab window related magmatism (e.g., in Baja California), but such a scenario has not been tested using fully dynamic numerical models. We use dynamic two-dimensional models including a non-Newtonian rheology to study the approach of a trench-parallel spreading ridge to a subduction zone. We find that before the ridge approaches within 100 km of the trench, detachment of the subducted slab occurs due to the combined effects of increased buoyancy and reduced strength of the lithosphere with ridge proximity. In models exploring effects of subducted slab length, distance of the ridge from the trench, shear zone strength, and lithospheric yield strength, we find the following: (1) a decrease in subduction velocity as the ridge approaches the trench, (2) a shrinking surface plate that maintains a uniform plate-like subduction velocity, (3) ridge abandonment distances 100–275 km from the trench, and (4) slab gap distances 195–285 km from the trench. These results are consistent with observations in Baja California, where detachment of the Cocos slab may explain abandonment of observed segments of the East Pacific Rise 50–200 km outboard of the trench and the presence of nonarc related magmatism located 100–250 km inboard of the trench. Ridge subduction does not occur within any of these two-dimensional cases of ridge-trench collision, indicating that 3-D geometric effects may be responsible for ridge subduction.},

 abstract = {Apatite (U-Th)/He ages from a vertical transect through the Santa Lucia Mountains, central California Coast Ranges, are used to reconstruct the history of exhumation and of bedrock and surface uplift in this region since ca. 6 Ma. We find a direct correlation between (U-Th)/He ages and elevation, which we interpret to correspond to denudation rates of approximately 0.35 mm/yr between 6 and 2 Ma. The onset of bedrock uplift and exhumation ca. 6 Ma followed a change in plate motion ca. 8 Ma. After 2 Ma, denudation rates increased substantially ( approximately 0.9 mm/yr). This is a rare instance in which long-term average bedrock ( approximately 0.85 mm/yr) and surface ( approximately 0.20 mm/yr) uplift can be calculated from denudation rates and stratigraphic data. The post-2 Ma denudation rate is about one order of magnitude higher than independently determined river erosion rates in the area. We suggest that this discrepancy indicates that exhumation of the steep western slopes of this segment of the Coast Ranges has been dominated by mass wasting via landslides, rather than fluvial erosion, at least since ca. 2 Ma. We also show that the bedrock uplift is predominantly tectonic, not isostatic.},

 abstract = {Continental magmatic arcs form above subduction zones where the upper plate is continental lithosphere and/or accreted transitional lithosphere. The best-studied examples are found along the western margin of the Americas. They are Earth's largest sites of intermediate magmatism. They are long lived (tens to hundreds of millions of years) and spatially complex; their location migrates laterally due to a host of tectonic causes. Episodes of crustal and lithospheric thickening alternating with periods of root foundering produce cyclic vertical changes in arcs. The average plutonic and volcanic rocks in these arcs straddle the compositional boundary between an andesite and a dacite, very similar to that of continental crust; about half of that comes from newly added mafic material from the mantle. Arc products of the upper crust differentiated from deep crustal ({\textgreater}40 km) residual materials, which are unstable in the lithosphere. Continental arcs evolve into stable continental masses over time; trace elemental budgets, however, present challenges to the concept that Phanerozoic arcs are the main factories of continental crust.},

 abstract = {Ultramafic inclusions from San Carlos, Arizona, are classified into two groups. Group I inclusions are dominated by magnesian (Mg/Mg + $\Sigma$Fe = 0.86 – 0.91), olivine-rich peridotites containing Cr-rich clinopyroxene and spinel. The less abundant Group I pyroxenites (containing Mg- and Cr-rich pyroxenes) occur as discrete inclusions and as portions of composite inclusions where they have a sharp, planar interface with lherzolite. Group II inclusions are dominated by clinopyroxene-rich peridotites containing Al- and Ti-rich augite and commonly abundant, Al-rich spinel. Compared to Group I inclusions, they are more Fe-rich (Mg/Mg + $\Sigma$Fe = 0.62 – 0.78) and more hetereogeneous in composition and modal proportions. Similar groups occur at many ultramafic inclusion localities. Our petrographic and geochemical results lead to the following conclusions. Olivine-rich Group I inclusions are not genetically related to the host basanite, and they are formed from two components. Component A is a partial melting residue; it comprises the major portion of these inclusions and determines the modal mineralogy and major and compatible trace element composition. Component B results from a small degree ({\textless}5{\%}) of garnet peridotite melting (probably, within the low-velocity zone). This highly LIL-element-enriched melt has migrated upwards into the overlying component A where it crystallized primarily as clinopyroxene and amphibole, and thus, introduced LIL elements into the residual component A. Subsequent cooling and subsolidus recrystallization have removed textural evidence of this mixing. This model has also been proposed for olivine-rich Group I inclusions from Victoria, Australia. At Victoria and San Carlos some relatively clinopyroxene-rich Group I lherzolites are not contaminated by component B, and they represent the best estimates of upper mantle composition prior to melting. Group I orthopyroxenites may be fragments of tectonic layers formed in lherzolite, but they could also be early cumulates (now metamorphosed) from the melt in equilibrium with component A. Group I clinopyroxenites have geochemical features of clinopyroxene in equilibrium with a magma. Thus, they could also represent early cumulates (now metamorphosed) from a magma unrelated to the host basanite. Alternatively, their geochemical characteristics could result from more complex models such as residues from partial remelting of pyroxenite dikes and veins or intradike segregation processes such as filter pressing. All Group II inclusions studied appear to be cumulates derived from a SiO2-undersaturated magma, possibly an early magma in the same volcanic episode which culminated with eruption of the host basanite. The poikilitic texture of amphibole-rich (kaersutite) inclusions is consistent with a cumulate origin. The bulk compositions of Group II inclusions are not equivalent to typical basaltic compositions.},

Calibration was performed using NIST SRM 610 in conjunction with internal standardisation using Ca. Determinations were also made on NIST SRM 612 and 614 as well as NIST SRM 610 as unknown samples, and included forty five major (Al and Na) and trace elements. Relative standard deviation (RSD) of determinations was below 10{\%} for most elements in all the glasses under investigation. Consistent exceptions were Sn and Sb in BCR-2G, BHVO-2G and BIR-1G. For BCR-2G, BHVO-2G and BIR-1G, clear negative correlations on a logarithmic scale exist between RSD and concentration for elements lower than 1500 µg g-1 with logarithmic correlation coefficients between -0.75 and -0.86. There is also a clear trend of increasing RSD with decreasing concentration from NIST SRM 610 through SRM 612 to SRM 614. These suggest that the difference in the scatter of apparent element concentrations is not due to chemical heterogeneity but reflects analytical uncertainty. It is concluded that all these glasses are, overall, homogeneous on a scale of 60 µm.  Our first results on BHVO-2G and BIR-1G showed that they generally agreed with BHVO-2/BHVO-1 and BIR-1 within 10{\%} relative. Exceptions were Nb, Ta and Pb in BHVO-2G, which were 14-45{\%} lower than reference values for BHVO-2 and BHVO-1. Be, Ni, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Sn, Sb, Gd, Tb, Er, Pb and U in BIR-1G were also exceptions. However, of these elements, Be, Nb, Sn, Sb, Gd, Tb, Pb and U gave results that were consistent within an uncertainty of 2s between our data and BIR-1 reference values. Results on NIST SRM 612 agreed well with published data, except for Mg and Sn. This was also true for elements with m/z {\textgreater} 85 (Rb) in the case of NIST SRM 614.},

 abstract = {An experimental study of the stability fields at high pressure of plagioclase peridotite, aluminous pyroxene (±spinel) peridotite and garnet peridotite, has been carried out in compositions matching estimates of the average undifferentiated upper mantle (pyrolite). The appearance of garnet at high pressures results from either of two complex reactions: 1.a.|spinel+pyroxene ⇌ olivine+garnet, (solid solutions)2.b.|aluminous pyroxene ⇌ garnet+pyroxene (lower Al2O3). (solid solution) In the model pyrolite composition, garnet appears at 21 kb (1100 °C) to 24 kb (1300 °C) by reaction (a) but at temperatures above 1300 °C spinel is absent from the low pressure assemblage and garnet develops by reaction (b) at pressures of 24 kb (1300 °C) to 31 kb (1500 °C). Reactions (a) and (b) have very different P, T gradients. In the garnet peridotite field, the amount of garnet is inversely proportional to the alumina content of the pyroxenes. This is confirmed by microprobe analyses of orthopyroxene (ranging from 6.0 to 2.2{\%} Al2O3, 0.7–0.9{\%} Cr2O3) coexisting with garnet, olivine and clinopyroxene. Coexisting clinopyroxenes have higher R2O3 content and exhibit a variable, temperature dependent enstatite solid solution. The experimental data are applied to estimate mineralogical, density and seismic velocity variations along oceanic and continental geothermal gradients in a pyrolite upper mantle. Although the mineralogical variation may produce a low velocity zone, the alternate explanation of incipient or minor partial melting is preferred. Experimental data on the maximum stability limit of amphibole in pyrolite (with 0.1–0.2{\%} water) are presented showing that amphibole breaks down to olivine+pyroxenes+garnet+fluid phase at approximately 29 kb, 1000 °C. The instability of amphibole at depths {\textgreater}80–90 km is considered to result in a zone of incipient or minor melting in a pyrolite upper mantle with 0.1–0.2{\%} water. The nature of the liquid in this zone is considered to be highly undersaturated olivine basanite or olivine nephelinite.},

@article{Humphreys1995,
 abstract = {I propose that post-Laramide removal of the subhorizontally subducting Farallon slab occurred by buckling downward along an approximately east-northeast–trending axis. This process was accomplished by a tearing or necking separation of the subducted slab near the northern and southern boundaries of the United States and propagation of the separated edges toward the central axis of downwelling, accompanied by aesthenosphic upwelling behind the trailing edges. Initial buckling probably began near 50 Ma, and slab removal was complete by 20 Ma. This model is based primarily on the space-time evolution of the ‘‘ignimbrite flare-up'' (a major midTertiary igneous event of mantle origin), which involved two propagating fronts of initiation of volcanism that followed the proposed motions of the separated slab edges as they converged on central Nevada from the north and southeast. Post-Laramide uplift, extension, establishment of the Cascadia subduction zone, and active magmatism may be consequences of lithosphere-scale modifications caused by the Laramide removal of the slab and the resulting asthenospheric upwelling.},

An attitude estimation scheme that does not use generalized coordinate representations of the attitude is presented here. Assuming that the initial attitude, angular velocity and measurement noise lie within given ellipsoidal bounds, an uncertainty ellipsoid that bounds the attitude and the angular velocity of the rigid body is obtained. The center of the uncertainty ellipsoid provides point estimates, and its size gives the accuracy of the estimates. The point estimates and the uncertainty ellipsoids are propagated using a Lie group variational integrator and its linearization, respectively. The estimation scheme is optimal in the sense that the attitude estimation error and the size of the uncertainty ellipsoid is minimized at each measurement instant, and it is global since the attitude is represented by a rotation matrix},

 abstract = {Olivine/melt and orthopyroxene/melt rare-earth element (REE) partition coefficients consistent with clinopyroxene/melt partition coefficients were determined indirectly from subsolidus partitioning between olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene after suitable correction for temperature. Heavy- and middle-REE ratios for olivine/clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene/clinopyroxene pairs correlate negatively with effective cationic radius, whereas those for the light REEs correlate positively with cationic radius, generating a U-shaped pattern in apparent mineral/clinopyroxene partition coefficients versus cationic radius. Lattice strain models of partitioning modified for subsolidus conditions yield negative correlations of olivine/clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene/clinopyroxene with respect to cationic radii, predicting well the measured partitioning behaviors of the heavy and middle REEs but not that of the light REEs. The light-REE systematics cannot be explained with lattice strain theory and, instead, can be explained by disequilibrium enrichment of the light REEs in melt inclusions or on the rims of olivine and orthopyroxene. Realistic light-REE partition coefficients were thus extrapolated from the measured heavy- and middle-REE partition coefficients using the lattice strain model. Light REE olivine/melt and orthopyroxene/melt partition coefficients calculated in this manner are lower than most published values, but agree reasonably well with partitioning experiments using the most recent in situ analytical techniques (secondary-ionization mass spectrometry and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). These new olivine/melt and orthopyroxene/melt partition coefficients are useful for accurate modeling of the REE contents of clinopyroxene-poor to -free lithologies, such as harzburgitic residues of melting. Finally, the application of the lattice strain theory to subsolidus conditions represents a framework for assessing the degree of REE disequilibrium in a rock. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The boundary is more prominent south of the Mendocino Triple Junction, where the Farallon Plate has completely subducted.

It distinguishes textures which are unambiguously igneous or metamorphic and divides metamorphic textures into four distinct types: porphyroclastic, cataclastic, foliated and equigranular mosaic. A separate category, allotriomorphic-granular, refers principally to coase-grained textures that are of unclear origin. In addition, textures that are dominated by partial melting are distinguished from igneous types. Interpretation of xenolith textures by reference to textures formed under experimental conditions is limited by lack of information about many of the factors which control xenolith textures. Until the effect of these factors is better understood, there can be no reliable completely genetic classification of xenolith textures.},

 abstract = {Variations in sea-floor depth and heat flow with age provide the main constraints on the thermal structure and evolution of the oceanic lithosphere. Joint fitting of heat flow and bathymetry yields a model with a hotter, thinner lithosphere than in previous models. The new model provides a significantly better fit to the data, including those from older lithosphere previously treated as anomalous. This will facilitate the analysis of lithospheric processes, including the effects of mid-plate volcanism and swells, regional subsidence, and hydrothermal circulation near spreading centers.},

@article{Wilson2005,
 abstract = {The geologic record of coastal California includes evidence of numerous volcanic centers younger than 30 Ma that do not appear to have erupted in an arc setting. By correlating these volcanic centers with specific slab windows predicted from analysis of magnetic anomalies on the Pacific plate, we add new constraints to tectonic reconstructions since 30 Ma. Our correlations, such as erupting the Morro Rock Islay Hill complex south of the Pioneer fracture zone and the Iversen Basalt south of the Mendocino fracture zone, require larger displacements within western North America than advocated by most previous authors. Specifically, we infer at least 315 km of motion between the Sierra Nevada and rigid North America at an azimuth of about N60 degrees W and at least 515 km between Baja California and rigid North America in a similar direction. A consequence of inferring a large displacement of Baja California is that the Pacific-North American plate boundary must have developed most of its current form prior to 10 Ma. We interpret a slab window developing between Cocos and Monterey plates after 19 Ma that reconstructs under nearly all of the southern California volcanic centers dated at 18-14 Ma. Most of the sedimentary basins associated with volcanic rocks show brief periods of rapid subsidence synchronous with volcanism, followed by slow subsidence of variable but often extended duration, consistent with rapid extension of cold lithosphere over recently introduced hot asthenosphere.},
